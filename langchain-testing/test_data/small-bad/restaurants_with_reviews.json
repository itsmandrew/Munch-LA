            "This was a great hotel. Whenever you clean your room, you come back, and it looks 10 times better. Everyone who works there was super nice and professional at the same time. During our trip, there was a homeless guy who was outside every day we were there.\n\nEdit: I think room service might have stolen my neck lace. I remembered taking it off, and I could find it anywhere. It wasn't expensive, and who knows? I might have just lost it, but I was very disappointed because I looked all over and couldn't find it.",
            "Absolutely recommend it.  Very quiet.  I didn\u2019t hear anything like many people say. I live in a big cities half New York and half London.  Room very spacious, internet for work my case was totally good.  Coffee was horrible. Receptionist very kind.  Safe area.  Metro and buses very good connections",
            "The front desk representative or whoever was in charge of picking up calls when they call the hotel's number around 9:30 AM - 10 AM on June 29 2024 was very rude and incompetent. They showed great signs of annoyance at the customer for making simple requests such as looking up their reservation for them. As someone also in the customer service industry it brings me great disappointment to have received customer service like this, so I think the hotel staff team should be made aware. This experience has affected my opinion of the hotel and I haven't even checked in for my stay yet.",
            "Great looking hotel and great location. We looked it up as a last minute alternative to a botched hotel reservation. The service left a lot to be desired. We checked in on Memorial Day afternoon. It would have been nice to know before we checked in that the restaurant/lounge that was located on the second floor, that was advertised as an amenity, was closed for the day.\n\nBut what made things worse was that the same restaurant/lounge was closed for it's 5:00pm opening the next day. When my wife and I required about the closing, the PM front desk attendant leisurely stated, \"The manager decided to close it down today.\" Very unprofessional approach to what is advertised as a swanky downtown LA hotel.\n\nWhen we got our ledger on Wednesday the 29th upon checkout, we noticed that we were charged an extra booking fee for our two day stay, even though we called the hotel directly and spoke to the front desk attendant directly to book the room. Of course, there was no hotel manager present to discuss the issue. Instead, we were re-directed to the accounting manager, who stated that we booked through a third party source. We stated that we contacted the aforementioned attendant, who greeted me when we checked in as \"the person I spoke to earlier\".\n\nHow can you book a room through a third party if you speak to the hotel directly?\n\nWe spoke to the accounting manager, Walter, about the miscommunication and discrepancy in the bill. As we were out of town guests and had to catch a flight, we had no time for him to do detailed diligence into the issue while we were still in person. We left contact information and informed Walter to give us a resolution, yay or nay, to the discrepancy of charges. We checked out on May 29. Today is June 6, have yet to hear from any management regarding a resolution either way.\n\nPoor handling.",
            "I really Enjoyed my stay at The E Central Hotel.\nRooms very clean and Modern trendy look. Also  Friendly staff . From Maria at front Desk to Tony helping me with my luggage or Lorenzo serving me a cocktail at the Lounge . The staff was very accommodating. The Property felt very secure . And the Location is Amazing. Walking distance from Crypto and Convention Center. Metro down the street as well as bus stops to get back to Union Station close by."

            "This place is located in an office building all the way at the end of the hall. My friends and I went to the restaurant near closing and were treated with so much care.\n\nWe decided to get a few items on the menu to share! We went with an appetizer, the dinner deal (which includes rice and 2 sides) and 2 dishes. The Samosas were great! Wish we had ordered more. For the dinner deal, we got the Black Lentil Dal and the Bergen. Then we ordered the Shahi Paneer and the Aloo Gobi (one of my favorite dishes). We got some garlic Naan and Aloo Paratha, I would recommend the ladder!\n\nThis restaurant is so underrated! This place has high quality food in a low-key place. The flavors of each dish were delicious!! Great Indian cuisine in DTLA!",

This place will make you feel like you\u2019re eating at someone\u2019s house; food prepared by the the grandma. Inside is just a room with nicely painted walls, but nothing else. I was skeptical until I tried the food. Every dish felt like it was freshly prepared for me and it was DELICIOUS. Naan nice and fluffy and they took their time preparing every dish (in a good way). Once again, don\u2019t expect anything on interior looks but rather taste. Definitely will be back.",

            "San Antonio Winery was the venue for my sister\u2019s baby shower today, it has been a quick month or so of planning. The service here is just amazing. From the first steps of planning with Sherrie to the actual set up of the event. The entire staff was so helpful, attentive, kind and professional. I really just can\u2019t say enough great things. The event went out perfectly, the food was delicious, the service courteous and attentive. All our guests raved about the quality of food and the wonderful service. If you are looking for a great venue with top notch service this is the place. Will definitely be a returning customer for future events. Sherri and Jennifer thank you for wonderful service, we could not have done it without you. The entire wait staff and just everyone in the building couldn\u2019t have been nicer. Thank you all!!",
            "I love the ambience here. I\u2019m not much of a wine connoisseur, however for all you wine lovers this is a hidden gem in metropolitan city of LA. Definitely a place to visit for brunch, they have an amazing outdoor setup with live music and and indoor intimate setting w a live jazz saxophonist. The experience itself is 4 stars but the food unfortunately for me was not the best. It\u2019s fast, and the service is incredible, but me personally I\u2019m used to different dishes. I highly recommend for a family brunch, drinks with the girls, and a nice brunch date.",
            "Great dining restaurant experience. We had our wedding reception here at their grand room last 2017. I love their classic jazz live music, adds a romantic flair to the experience. You can dress up or be casual, either way, you\u2019ll feel warm & special. Food is great and at reasonable price. Meal is about $20 & above. Great place to be!",
            "Arrived to San Antonio Winery for a mystery dinner, wow! Wished we had arrived earlier so we could look around and shop. It was surprising to find such a gem tucked away in DTLA. Lovely and warm atmosphere, excellent wine and products!\n\nWe had a great time at the venue and would love to come back. Everything was wonderful (although we share the sentiment with the other reviews - food wasn't all that good, but it was one event), it was worth it and we'll definitely return for more!",
            "I\u2019m here for lunch and the place is beautiful. They have some light food such as sandwiches or you can have pasta or main courses and you could have the sips for different red wines for sure. The service also pretty good."

The sweetness and tartness was nicely balanced. It doesn\u2019t come with whip cream but get it you won\u2019t regret it. Coffee skip it and get something else.",
            "Bottega Louie is a delightful spot for a family lunch outing. We recently dined in and had a memorable experience from start to finish. Despite arriving at peak lunchtime, the wait for a table was a brief 5 minutes, which was quite impressive. Our meal was a culinary delight. We started with the Short Rib Raviolo, which was rich and flavorful. The Avocado & Chorizo Toast was a perfect blend of creamy and spicy, while the Portobello Fries added a delightful crunch. The Caesar salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. Each dish was not only delicious but also beautifully presented.\n\nThe guest room was fantastic, offering a comfortable and welcoming ambiance. The washroom was spotless, reflecting the overall cleanliness and attention to detail of the establishment. The atmosphere had a little noise, typical for a busy lunch hour, but it was perfectly cool and pleasant. The music system played cool sounds and an amazing playlist that added to the overall enjoyable experience.\n\nBottega Louie is a fair and reasonable place regarding prices, especially considering the quality of the food and service. It\u2019s also incredibly kids-friendly, making it an ideal spot for family dining. The outdoor seating was beautifully decorated, adding an extra layer of charm to the dining experience.\n\nThe staff was active and super quick, ensuring we had everything we needed throughout our meal. The manager was both handsome and professional, checking in on us to ensure everything was to our satisfaction. Parking was plentiful, which is always a bonus in a busy area. Overall, Bottega Louie is a fantastic choice for a family lunch. With its delicious food, attentive service, and lovely ambiance, it\u2019s a place we\u2019ll definitely be returning to.

            "Truly one of the best sushi spots in LA. The fish is fresh and the service is great. Although you have to wait a bit, the lunch special is pretty worth. Everything on the a La carte menu is a great choice too.",
            "Sushi Gen is Los Angeles\u2019 premier authentic sushiya and should be a point of pilgrimage for every serious lover of sushi. Since 1980 this place has been serving some of the best quality (and best priced) sushi in LA.\n\nI recommend coming for lunch, as getting seated for dinner can take up to 2 hours. The sushi counter is a la carte only, however, the table seating offers the same a la carte sushi menu as well as a variety of classic japanese dishes and sushi combinations. Their lunchtime sushi combination is particularly popular and well priced.\n\nThe sushi counter experience is one of the best in LA county and every piece of fish is of top quality and preparation.",

We also got the sushi deluxe combination to split. The sashimi lunch special was the best value item!\n\nCome early to wait! We got in line around 10:20 on a Tuesday morning and got in with the first group to be seated (they open at 11 and the line is pretty long by 10:30. We found out that the a la carte menu is only served at the bar so if you want to to order off the normal menu, make sure you grab a table instead of sitting at the bar.",
            "Genuinely disappointed in this place since the line was so long and people hyped it up. We lined up right at 10:30am and got in the 2nd group. My husband got the premium chirashi and I got the deluxe sushi set with salmon skin salad and mozuku. The salad was alright, looked better than it tasted. The mozuku was really sour and vinegary which i wasnt a fan of.\n\nThe deluxe sushi set was such a let down though, some of rolls were so basic (cucumber rolls?!) And it just didnt taste like what a deluxe set would be. Maybe i ordered the wrong thing but my husbands chirashi was just \"okay\" as well.\n\nThe place is also very old and could use a reno.\n\nAlso to top it off a crazy man was running around naked while we were waiting for the restaurant to be open. Not their fault obviously but an interesting experience to start the morning lol."

            "The French dip sandwiches here are really delicious. Last time I went for lunch it was very crowded and I had to wait about 30 minutes, but this time I went just before closing time and it was empty so I was able to order right away. The food comes out quickly and the prices are cheap. Best of all, the lemonade and iced tea are less than a dollar a glass. That's a miraculous price in LA right now. The French dip is simple but well seasoned, soft, juicy and very tasty. And the chili soup here is just too good. It's rich and hearty, and I highly recommend it!\n\nLastly, even though this is downtown LA, the restaurant has free parking! That's also super nice! Go get your sandwich there today!!!",
            "Been here many times for beef dip sandwich and thought I\u2019d get breakfast. Ordered pork chop plate with two eggs, hash brown and biscuits. All were good and pork chops cooked medium with seasoning. Hash browns a bit salty, but doable. The biscuits were fresh. Service runs a bit slow here as preparing food is made to order, so seems slow. Vibe is good. I\u2019d say the pricing have skyrocketed here\u2026I\u2019ve seen the slices of pie at $3.95 to $5.95, NOW $7.95!!! Wow! I\u2019ll never order a pie here again. Even with cost going up, no way can they justify $8 slices LOL!",

It\u2019s a habit that I try to go in search of places tried out by Anthony Bourdain and this places popped up as a must try for their French dipped lamb sandwiches!! What was great was got one sandwich and you can choose if you want it dipped once or twice or fully in the French onion! The lamb was so great and a must try iconic place in LA!",

            "Really fantastic German food and beer, which is less common in LA. Their focus is on different types of bratwurst and beers, including some more unique flavors like rattlesnake and rabbit. We took my uncle here for his 21st and he got one of the large mugs of beer. We each got a different type of sausage and shared fries with a variety of dipping sauces. They have an outdoor seating area, as well as an inside area with a secondary bar and DJ area, but I'm not sure when the DJ plays. The atmosphere is dark with large community tables and some private tables around the corners of the restaurant. Really fun spot to go with friends or family if you just want to have some drinks, good food and enjoy the evening.",
            "I recently visited Wurstk\u00fcche, hoping for an enjoyable meal in a vibrant atmosphere. While the food was quite good, the dining experience was significantly marred by the uncomfortable environment. The dining room was extremely humid and hot, making it difficult to fully enjoy the meal. It felt like the space was missing a couple of big fans on the ceiling to improve air circulation and provide some much-needed relief from the heat. Until they address this issue, it's hard to fully recommend dining in, especially on a warm day.",
            "Phenomenal German food in a heavily food populated area. This place sticks out well with the quality compared to others in the area. They have a few unique blends of bratwurst, which I had the rabbit and rattlesnake blend (very good!). I also tried the original bratwurst, and fries. I\u2019d say everything was very good and worth coming again. Make sure to check your receipt, I was charged for two beers but only asked for one.

For my beverage, I opted for Reed's Spiced Apple Brew, an apple soda with prominent notes of cinnamon and clove. While the pairing may not have been conventional, I had requested to be surprised with my beverage selection.\n\nUnfortunately, the outdoor dining experience was somewhat marred by an abundance of flies, reminiscent of the fourth plague of Egypt. Despite this minor inconvenience, the food was delectable, and the service was commendable.",

This location is big and has tons of seating inside and out. i went with some friends and we split a couple hotdogs (sorry i didn\u2019t get any pics really) they have such unique combinations. Definitely worth a stop and trying out something new or go on a fun date. We also split this beer platter with mini glasses which was fun and perfect size for us. We were exploring and made this a stop and we were happy we made it. definitely a downtown gem."

Last time I went they just used a sharpie to blacken out most of the menu and wouldn't put anything on the side! What a difference!!! The pastas were all fantastic.

They literally threw utensils down in front of the kids, we had to ask for each thing 3-4 times before they actually brought it to us (the place was not busy and the table right next to us was getting their things promptly), and the original server acted annoyed that he even had to serve us.

Long story short food was decent service was not I may or may not go back again. There",

No welcome,  no instructions,  no recommendations,  they didn't turn on the grill until we asked for 15 minutes after sitting there.  And that was just the first 20 minutes.  We finally got food to start grilling but literally had to hunt down someone to change the grill.  When we tried to call someone over for drinks, the server looked at us, stopped walking, and ignored us. The location and parking are so convenient.  The food is average.  But with a $33 \u2010$45 price tag, it's not worth the extremely unprofessional rude service.  Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.",

Meat comes out really fast, salad bar doesn't actually have salad, but has jello, macaroni salad, and fried foods!\nLittle automatic robot comes around delivering food to tables is super cool.\nIt was $80 for two people and two drinks. We had ayca Gold. Pretty cheap for how pretty and fast the restaurant is, along with how much food you can potentially get. One table seats 6 but they're bunched up next to each other."

There\u2019s an elevator to take up to the restaurant area. The dining area is nice, lots of open space and city views. The food is okay, could\u2019ve been better but it\u2019s okay for a brunch. I ordered the avocado toast. It was a bit tasteless. If I visit again I may try something else. The drinks were good from what I hear. After ordering at the restaurant, we went up to the rooftop where the views are spectacular. There\u2019s a bar and a couple restrooms, as well as spaces to sit. Definitely a must go for the views.",
            "Awesome Saturday night in downtown LA at the Perch. Brett was very accommodating and engaging. He made our great experience greater. Maybe we got lucky, as this was our first time, but that would be hard to believe. The music on the rooftop was fantastic, we ate excellent meals, had great service, and danced. A spectacular date night.",
            "I truly enjoyed my experience at perch. I arrived during the happy hour around 4 PM. This was the perfect time to go. The restaurant wasn\u2019t really crowded and we got one of the best seats in the restaurant that overlooked the city.\n\nNot only was the view awesome, but the food was also very delicious. \ud83e\udd24\n\nI recommend coming during the happy hour honestly because you get the opportunity to order a little bit of this and a little bit of that. During this time you can order from their happy hour menu and fromfrom the dinner menu.",

The food in a good quality I asked to replace the pasta with penne and arugula pesto and turned out very good, tried the wagyu sirloin medium a little bit dry but tasted well, the grilled octopus well marinated with beet and onion puree",
            "Drago was the perfect place for my friend\u2019s graduation dinner. They have a private room which we rented out for about 30 guests. It fit 5 tables of 6 people.

We had a preset 4-course menu with two options to pick from for each course. I had the burrata and heirloom salad, wild mushroom risotto, NY steak with fingerling potatoes and broccoli and the tiramisu.  The portions were perfect and the taste was incredible. Also had a dirty vodka martini and espresso martini. Both were great! The espresso martini is at the top of my list for best espresso tinis I have had.",
            "I came to Drago Centro for the first time for my 16th birthday dinner back in October with my friends and I had no reservation but that wasn\u2019t an issue because there were still plenty of seats available. I ordered the pheasant pappardelle which was recommended to me by server and it was really good. I was unsure about getting it because of the pheasant but it tasted just like chicken. For dessert, I had a surprise birthday special of mango cheesecake that was on the house which was really nice of them. The servers were very nice and amazing with suggestions, overall customer service was 10/10! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who\u2019s looking for an Italian restaurant in downtown LA. Food was delicious and the bar has a variety of drinks to choose from."

            "Yesterday, my pal and I came here for happy hour drinks/food. The drinks were tasty and the bartenders who made them were nice. The food was typical bar food... I ordered the fried cauliflower, which was great, but the loaded fries weren't as exciting. I was OK with it, though. It's bar food, I guess.\n\nAs soon as we ordered our drinks, we were asked if we wanted to open a tab. Yes. But, since it was two of us, we wanted to open a tab for each. They explained it was easier to put us on one tab, then separate when we checked out. Weird, but OK.\n\nWe go to close our tab/settle our bill, and they drop off one bill. I flagged the bartender lady down to tell her we were supposed to have two separate bills, and all she said was, \"Sorry.\" Like, Oopsie, sorry, but no, we're not going to bother separating your bill.\n\nAnd then it got really weird. My friend looked at the bill and she was charged regular price for two drinks and one of the appetizers. She was also charged 20% for gratuity because the bill was over $100.\n\nFirst of all, we specifically requested we separate our tabs when we arrived and were told we could when we closed our bill. They didn't honor that. All we got was a \"sorry.\" We both think the reason they don't split bills is so they can charge 20% gratuity.  And, seriously, it's not like we ordered a ton of food. 3 appetizers and 4 drinks, and the bill was $128 dollars! I tip well, so it's not like they wouldn't have gotten a decent tip from me, anyway.\n\nAnd then, it got REALLY weird. It took three people in a huddle to review the overcharge. The lady bartender brought it over and said it had been fixed. My friend looked at it, and it STILL wasn't. They didn't fix the overcharge on her appetizer. She brought it to the attention of the lady bartender and she was like, \"the chicken was $5.\" My friend was like, \"I'm going to go ahead and pay it, but your website/menu says the chicken is $2 extra, NOT $5.\" That's when the lady got really curt and said, \"we're aware and we're working on fixing it.\"\n\nHere's my second of all: if you have a listed price for Happy Hour, but it's wrong, you should still honor it. YOU made the mistake, not the customer. That's super bad business to be like, \"It's wrong, so you have to pay the price we don't have listed on the website.\" Not only that, but when they huddled together to review the bill, then brought it back, the lady bartender said it had been fixed. No, no, it hadn't been, and she knew it.\n\nSad. 2 stars for the cool decor and for the nice bartenders we had at the beginning.",
            "The name says it all. They have books and drinks. Atmosphere is dark library meets bar. Bartender knows how to make good drinks. Happy hour is 3-7 pm Monday through Friday. Paid $10 for French 75 which was delicious during happy hour.",
            "Such a relaxed and fun spot to chill. This place has been here for a while - and food and drinks are consistently good. Good team and good crowd of folks. Thanks for the fun happy hours and nights..",
            "Loveddddd the aesthetic! The food was saturated in salt. Aside from that i had a great time. Some of the drinks were book inspired, eg: Of Mice and Gin, and Tequila Mockingbird! I ended up getting my favorite, French 75!",
            "Such a cute spot ! Came on a Sunday and very relaxing. Food was so delicious and drinks strong.  Sliders were $22 and each drink about $18 each."

Can't wait to return for more culinary delights.",
            "I\u2019ve been wanting to check this spot out and I was free after a workout. Solid restaurant with top quality food.\n\nI had their wild Spanish octopus, wild jumbo shrimp Louie salad, a half dozen oyster sampler & a latte. The octopus was very tender and delicious, probably one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. The oyster sampler was also very delicious. Shucked perfectly and the dipping choices were excellent.  The latte was also great. The Louie salad was good but I was expecting a different flavor, it\u2019s a filling salad but I think it didn\u2019t match my prior meals which is my fault but a good salad nonetheless.\n\nCustomer service was great and attentive, thanks to Johnnny. He even asked asked if I wanted mixed or a deconstructed version of the salad. I was hungry, so tossed was it! Also a small detail, they got a coat rack!\n\nI\u2019d definitely come back again and try their other menu items. Parking is very limited to street or paid parking spots(dtla problems).",

We decided on Water Grill; the atmosphere was fantastic, and the staff was friendly. However, the service was slow, and it took quite a while for our food to arrive. On the bright side, if you enjoy classic margaritas, they make the best here. I would certainly recommend this location for a visit.",

Valet parking was easy, had to drive through the alley and $12 fee covered until 3a for those that want to dine and then party after. I had reservations and had to wait 5-10 minutes, however was completely fine since there is a full bar in the reception area. Ambiance was nice, dimly lit so you can enjoy the views of the LA skyline. Had a table outside, which was perfect and already warm due to the various wall mounted heaters throughout. The restaurant has 3+ different kitchens for sushi, warm dishes and grilled foods, providing a versatile Japanese menu. The drinks were also amazing... Tokyo Mule, yes 2 please!!!\nAppetizer and food came extremely quick, only wait time was on the drinks, which wasn't that long and definitely worth the wait.",

We sat in their lounge couch area, but not once during the about 1-1.5 hours while we were there were all tables full. We could have easily been sat at a 2 person table.",

Our server was very upbeat and kind.\nTo be honest, I expected the sushi to be better. It was just okay.. definitely not \u201chigh quality\u201d sushi.

Turn and burn so it's not hard to grab a table since people order, eat and leave in a timely fashion. Plus, pack up as many peppers as your little heart desires. We sure did and it complimented our sandwiches.\n\nWe had the Chicago roast beef special w/pepper jack cheese, the roast beef+pastrami+provolone and a kids salami+turkey+pepper jack cheese. The meat to bread ratio was plentiful. No skimping here. The au jus was seasoned perfectly.\n\nWe noticed they had the lasagna special today (Thursday).

When greeted, we were offered \"a large bottle of water for the table.\" I wasn't clear if this meant tap water or purchasing bottled water for a fee, so I asked and it was the latter. Felt a little slippery to me. Also, our entrees took a lot longer than what was communicated to us, but I think that's because when we sat down the place was nearly empty and 20 minutes later it was busy. The drinks were very good; I ordered the Moscow Mule. Wedge salad was enjoyable and the stuffed sea bass was also well prepared. A better variety of dessert options would have been nice.

Just did her job asked what we needed and left. The food arrived. The wings were good again not great. We also ordered sweet potato fries that were soggy and the pancakes with fried chicken and the pancakes were also soggy. Gross. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps with shrimp replacement and they brought me a plate with a piece of lettuce some sauce and shrimp in this fried edible bowl that was tasteless it literally had no flavor. I\u2019ve had lettuce wraps before and there\u2019s also a lot of other ingredients like nuts and veggies. This one? Nope. Just a piece of lettuce and shrimp \ud83e\udd23 Even tho I was embarrassed to complain about the food it didn\u2019t sit right with me to just sit there and pay full price for a meal we didn\u2019t even enjoy. So I complained to the manager about the food and we got a discount but I still left a good tip. I will not be coming back here it doesn\u2019t have a welcoming environment and the food sucked.

            "A top 3 LA sushi restaurant, probably one of the closest to authentic Japanese sushi. Definitley some of the best little Tokyo has to offer. The sushi plate was fresh and with subtle flavors in the fish.",
            "We placed a Togo order for a delightful variety of dishes at this Japanese restaurant located in downtown LA. It happens to be one of my brother's favorite places, and he was determined to welcome me with a special dinner from here, despite the crazy Friday traffic in the area. Arriving a little early, we patiently waited for them to open at exactly 5:00 pm. Since our order was quite substantial, they kindly brought the food to our car in the parking structure. My generous brother left a big tip for both the waitress and the person who delivered the food. The entire family thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I opted for the chirashi, which was a generous portion of fresh sashimi, rice, and a variety of veggies. It paired perfectly with my niece's favorite beer, Allagash Curieux, which I found to be excellent. Later, we also indulged in some sake. The gathering was filled with heartwarming conversations and scrumptious food, making it a truly cherished moment for all of us. Such experiences remind us of the joy of family gatherings and the simple pleasures of life.",
            "Sushi is very fresh! Good service!",
            "Took a friend for an impromptu omakase lunch at the sushi bar. Pretty much a tasting menu of their today\u2019s special/fresh catches. Super fatty toro, and tried some that are usually rarely appeared on the menu. Love it! Very good quality & freshness. Their marinated mushroom was soo naturally sweet (no sugar added). $140 per person (this price might change based on type of fishes available. It\u2019s comparable to those more famous omakase joint. Just that you are not paying extra for the decoration. This is a cozy family run old school goodness. Oh and their house made wasabi/scalllion sauce is so good I wish I could buy some to take home!",
            "The worst sushi place ever..the Taisho has some kind of a weird policy where you can\u2019t order certain foods on the counter. First red flag. I wanted to get the Matsu Nigiri combo so I went ahead and switched to a table. The sushi came out and the nigiri sushi was literary made miniature. I lived in Japan for 20 years and LA for 10 years and never seen anything like this lol I couldn\u2019t believe it at first but see the pictures for your reference. The rice amount is literary the size of your nails. Do yourself a favor and never come here for sushi. You\u2019re gonna get robbed."
