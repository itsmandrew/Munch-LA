      "We went for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, because they have the softest corn beef I\u2019ve ever had along with mustard and cabbage and carrots, and the dinner was just spectacular. And of course, their cheese bread is to literally die for. Our server was quite pleasant and smiling and full of energy. Looks like they won\u2019t be moving until after the first of the year so they\u2019re in that building for the holidays. That made my mom and I very happy. She\u2019s 84 and I\u2019m 58 and we\u2019ve been going to The Derby for decades. Things seem not to change including Quality which is for the better. Never eaten here. I highly recommended at least once, and especially for a first date that sets quite the rich atmosphere and provides for intimacy as well.",
      "I love a good steakhouse and always look for the closest to my travel destination. The building and atmosphere are nice, and I like the history behind it. Our server was efficient but didn't have much charm, and was supported by others so that we didn't have to wait long for any dish. Overall the food was good, but fell a bit short of my expectations for the price point. French onion soup was delicious, and definitely on point. My NY strip was overdone but still acceptable to eat without asking them to redo it. The green beans were of varying texture and also overcooked. Mushrooms were good and the marsala sauce was a flavorful accompaniment to my steak as an alternative to butter. Salmon was cooked well and sauce was a nice pairing. Desserts were a substantial size, and the creme brulee was larger than you'd receive most places. Triple scoop of sorbet was an assortment of flavors and textures - raspberry (my favorite of the three) was creamy and not sharp, passionfruit was vibrant, but the blood orange was weak on flavor. Bread pudding was more like a dense cake than traditional preparation, but tasted good. Overall it was a satisfying dinner, but I've had much better meals at other fine steakhouses and expected a bit more here.",
      "I've loved this place throughout the years. After a great day down the steeet at Santa Anita, a perfect steak and starters is the only way to finish.\n\nEnjoyed the Calamari, Rib-eye and my date had the Prime rib. The Mac n cheese was delicious, almost like scalloped potatoes meets pasta. Wonderful, attentive service.",
      "Very tasty and a little bit expensive! But all cost every dollar! And we took three cocktails and port wine, they increased an amount...\nIt was my birthday and Derby gifted me a dessert. Very -very-very pretty place!\nThe best file minion, very good onion soup, very good appetizers and unbelievable tasty fried bread. I want to return only for this bread!\nHot Margarita is really hot spicy \ud83d\udd25 I needed to drink it with Pina Colada )))\nBeautiful place I will go again.",
      "Absolutely amazing service and food. Bobby M made us feel so welcomed , he was very attentive , helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our food very much, the entire staff was so generous and wonderful \ud83d\ude00 We look forward to co.ing back soon!"

      "We came here to celebrate my husbands bday. Food was cooked to perfection. Customer service was good. The manager is very kind gave us shots and wrote happy bday in it. We ordered the all smoke platter. We have plenty of left overs for dinner and probably the next day. We ordered it with Mac n cheese, Mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts and waffle fries. We ate during happy hour and the drinks are buy one and get on free of the same drink.",
      "Very busy place on a Friday night, and a nice selection of items on the menu. The pastrami was amazingly good, I'm so glad I chose it over the brisket - tender and full of flavor. The beef short rib was also very good, moist and tender but not fatty, although the rub was excessively salty. Pickles were perfectly pickled and crunchy. Mud pie was the choice of dessert for several at our table and was enjoyed all around. The service was sufficient but not stellar - some hospitality faux pas like serving drinks by holding the rim, and not bussing any dishes from the table until the very end of the meal. I'd definitely return for more of the delicious meat!",
      "When we first survived, we were sat down in the crowded area Not easy to get to our seats!\nThen a sworm of Kids came in at least 20 of them. They were so loud people behind us and in front of us were yelling at each other in order to be able to hear their conversation.\nSo we were brought our menus. 10 min later we were offered to order our drinks. 10-15 min later we ordered our food.\n1 hour later were served. Along with burnt shrimp as an appetizer\nOnly burnt appetizers arrived at our table. So we just ignored it. Then, as you can tell the picture, I didn't have hardly any Avacado lettuce was just thrown on the plate I had four pecans or nuts in it whatever they are in a few cranberries I had to ask for dressing because some of the dressing was already on it, which I've never had it served. That way they usually put it on the side. And I had to ask for the other fixings Avacado was smooshed in there. He was one little piece like the end of the avocado. .Then one of the guest I brought pulled a hair out of the food. After that, it was very disgusting.\nI couldn't eat anymore. Neither could anybody else\nLet the waiter know what was going on and he apologize for having our food brought up to us late. He stated that the ticket got lost in the kitchen one and two for the Hair He said he would let his manager know.\nAnd apparently the managers went to the office as we patiently waited 15 minutes for them to arrive. According to the waiter, they might be viewing the cameras that's why they're delaying coming to the table.\nThere was no reason for us to be dishonest, if anything was more humiliating to the guest that I took of the poor service not only that, but the meat was cold\nEverything was not acceptable. Then the manager comes over to tell us that she was not gonna charge us for our alcohol drinks to compensate what we have experience I believe her name was Wendy. Yes, that's her name. Poor management If you look at my other yelp reviews for this restaurant, you'll see the difference in the food!!!",
      "Food was amazing.  The birria quessadilla is a great appetizer and you can never go wrong with a pile of meat for food.  Good place to share plates if you want to try everything.  This version is in the mall and is really light and airy.  Looks totally new, which I think it is.  We got there at 6 on a Monday and it was empty bit filled up fast while we were there.  Came back at 6:15 on a Thursday and it was still empty, but filled up quick.",
      "Very, very bad service. Like extremely bad.\n\nAlso want to add they charge a 3% service fee. Since I had already waited so long for my server to come back with my change I did not bring it up and ask why. At this point I was very annoyed considering the place was practically empty besides one large party coming in while I was waiting for my change.\n\nI wanted to leave no tip considering the horrible service, but I left a small tip and took the service fee off the tip as well.\n\nIt was nice that we received a free quesadilla but it honestly doesn't make up for it, imo."

      "For some reason, a search on Google Maps for \"coffee\" didn't put this one on the map, and I was a half block away at the medical buildings. I'm glad that I saw the sign outside for gourmet coffee! (I was resigned to going to a certain big chain....) I pulled over and parked on the street. What a cute place for sandwiches, pastries, wines and....did I mention coffee? I ordered a cappuccino from a friendly welcoming barista. She made it nice and strong and hot. \ud83d\udc4d \u2615\ufe0f I want to bring my mom back here for lunch. I love the whole French bistro vibe. (Maybe if I put coffee enough in my review it will pop up on the map next time? I don't know how Google Maps search results work. Coffee. \u2615\ufe0f Coffee. Coffee was great!)",
      "I have ordered here a number of times, generally taking the time to sit down and eat on the patio with either a book or some work. It is a large, gorgeous patio, surrounded by beautiful, greenery, and shades, that they roll up or down depending on the time of the day. You can never go wrong with a ham and cheese sandwich, but I'm also a major fan of the roast beef. My friend loved the meatloaf, and when I took my mother, she was a big fan of the vegetable quiche she had ordered. I also once tried their chicken wings, which were way too delicious and they are introducing pizza but so far nothing I've ordered or had from here has been bad, so I'll definitely check it out.",
      "Always want to try this cafe. Wow! Very impressive. Much better than my imagine. Semi outdoor setting is so relaxing and cozy. The indoor environment is homey.\nI tried my regular  Cafe Latte that they use illy coffee. I think my drip illy coffee is better.\ud83e\udd2d\nThe Orange Cranberry Muffin was so big... Actually I prefer a smaller size. \ud83d\ude04\nI enjoyed coffee and muffin plus my Bible reading. Definitely I will go back to enjoy my ME time.\nAlso, very suitable for girls chit chat gathering.\ud83d\ude09",
      "Great food it tasted fresh. We ordered the roast beef and turkey sandwich. Cool spot to eat at. Great customer service. We will be coming back and trying other sandwiches.\n\nUpdate-We ate here again and again it was delicious but this time we had a chance to meet the owner and his daughter they are so nice and welcoming they walked us in the back to show us how fresh the meat is! I wish I took a picture because it looked delicious. So fresh and great service. I look forward to eating here again!\n\nUpdate- ate here again and once again amazing!! I ordered the roasted turkey with added bacon \ud83d\ude0b\n\nI will continue coming back here. I look forward to trying their pizza next \ud83c\udf55",
      "I heard a lot of hype from family, so I went to check it out. I've been there twice now. The first time was an OK experience. The food was pricey, and the quality was average. The second time, I ordered an extra meat option on the sandwich. I was charged for it, but it seemed like they used less of the first meat, then added a bit of the second option. It was not worth it. For just one sandwich and a drink, I paid over $25. The size was a maybe a 5-inch baguette slice. The service was neither good nor bad. It was a typical order, pay, and receive transaction. The atmosphere had some cool touches, but in the end, it was still in Temple City. Run down buildings and traffic just outside of the patio. I place more value on the food and the cost."

      "Newly opened dim sum restaurant adds expanding dim sum culinary options in Arcadia. Occupying the former Marie Calendar's restaurant space, Enlighten Bistro 168 is not a typical dim sum restaurant, it tries to differentiate itself with good foods with contemporary vibes.\n\nOnce you walk into the restaurant, you're greeted with a fresh and bright dining area with tables spaced out to create a well balanced feel.\n\nWith the modern decor comes with the refreshing friendly service. Unlike other typical dim sum restaurants, the waiters here are dressed in the uniform that's typical for high end restaurants for steaks. The services rendered by the waiters match their uniform. When we dined here, we got excellent service.\n\nThe foods are hit and missed. Some are very good but others are just ok. I liked their sticky rice in lotus leaf which had good rice and flavorful fillings. So was the fried noodle with soy sauce, crispy and full of wok Hei.\n\nOn the other hand, the Shao Mai was just ordinary. The meat was stale and the flavor was bland.\n\nThe prices are on the high side but not out of the extraordinary as compared to Chef Tony next door. Will come back again to try their BBQ stuff and fried rice, I saw a lot people order them.",
      "Drove past this location couple weeks ago and saw long lines out the door so I was intrigued. Decided to visit this past weekend and I was let down by the positive reviews on Yelp. Out of the all the dim sum places in the 626 area, I personally do not believe this restaurant elevated the dishes to what seems like a \"high class\" dim sum restaurant based on their prices. Most dim sum dishes here at $6.88 each, while there are a few cheaper than that and plenty that are more expensive than that.\n\nThe prices obviously don't reflect the size of the dishes. The dumplings I ordered were way smaller than other restaurants. While they tasted okay, I felt the dumpling skin was too thick and made more of a chewy texture to it. The three dumplings we ordered was the Scallop Seafood Dumpling, Leek Dumpling, and Shrimp Dumpling. I do not recommend getting the Baked Radish Puff because it came out cold. It was probably made a day ago and they popped it in the oven or microwave. The Egg Yolk Bao was great; the inside was nice and hot and literally creamy. It's smaller than I imagined but still great to order. I also ordered the Curry Eel Fried Rice but after 35 minutes of order, it did not come out yet. I asked one server where it was and she told me the kitchen was working on it. 10 minutes passed and I asked a different server and she told me they haven't even prepared it. That honestly tells me that there's no communication or they just want you to wait so they don't lost money on dishes.\n\nFYI, the dining area is EXTREMELY SMALL so it's packed. If you're not comfortable with such a tight spot, order to-go. Overall, I don't think I would return for $7 dumplings plus $2 tea per person. I'd rather order a meal from another restaurant that will satisfy my cravings than 3 dumplings.",
      "By far one of the better dim sum places in the greater LA area.  Can get busy so arrive promptly.",
      "Tried their Creamy Egg Yolk Bun, Siew Mai, Har Gow, and Crispy German Pork Knuckle. The Buns and Har Gow were pretty good, nothing unique, but the Siew Mais were probably the JUICIEST ones i've had in a while. Other places offer larger ones in size, but this place definitely has the taste, texture, and quality knocked out of the park  only tiny complaint would be that the prices are about a dollar higher than other places.\n\nThe Pork Knuckles took a while to come out, but the taste was BOMB. Crispy & Juicy :)\n\n9/10",
      "Ordered to go last weekend, very good package! The food was AMAZING. Do not forget to try Creamy egg yolk bao(That black-gold bun)!"

      "While walking around the mall, I saw some people walking around with giant baby bottles. I was immediately intrigued and wanted one as well.\n\nI found them at the food court, and it felt like a party! Everyone was super friendly, and offered everyone samples! They gave me suggestions as to what to mix, which ones were popular and to try flavors I never would have tried! My favorite was the mango and watermelon, it was very refreshing. If you purchase a baby bottle or duck, they even give you a voucher for a free refill!\n\nTheir menu consists of a variety of items, ranging from fun festival food to Mexican food. We decided to try the steak fries and the steak fajitas. The steak fries were topped with a generous portion of sliced steak and delicious cheese. The steak fajitas smelled wonderful! I loved how flavorful the meat was, very well seasoned and really good, even the Mexican rice was delicious.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to come back and try the spiral potatoes and the other Aguas Fresca flavors!",
      "Wow! Delicious aqua Fresca in so many flavors. The potato swirl was really yummy too. The free sample really helped decide what flavor. Vanessa was so sweet and kind. She checked and the potatoes and fish are not fried in the same oil. Ten out of ten totally recommend. Forget Starbucks I\u2019ll take aqua Fresca \ud83d\ude0b",
      "Their Agua Frescas are really good! Nice selection of flavors too! And fairly affordable! Always a plus in my books! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb My friend ordered their Siu Maai & Haa Gow of all things, AFTER having had Dim Sum too! I have yet to ask him how it tastes.

Over all the food was OK, but would not go back.  There are better noodle places for less the cost.

Granted you get to customize alot, but that in itself makes each bowl of noodle more tasty. The main soup base is both impressive and tasty.\nThe karage shouldn't be skipped either. It was crispy, juicy and flavorful.\nOverall it was a fantastic experience. And I understand why there there can be a line on a Tuesday night. Deferred worth it.",

They have a cool custom menu that you fill out while waiting in line to stream line the process. Big fan of the organization! Highly recommend.",

      "First visit today. First review:  5 of had lunch after church today.  My friend picked this place and I was eager to try.\n\nPORK CUTLET.  One of the best pork cutlets I've ever had!  The pork cutlet was flakey and crispy on the outside, yet juicy and tasty on the insides. Tender, not tough. It's definitely one the 3 top dishes to order. So many different sauces. One of my favs.\n\nThe most popular was the JOKBAL: Pork feet and hock slices. It's a large dish. Very unique. Must try with a large group (4 to 6 people.)\n\nAnd lastly 2 different soups.  Galbitang: Beef short rib soup with glass noodles. The noodles were nice snd chewy. And the other one was the milky one. Also good on a cold day.\n\nThe service staff spoke fluent Chinese and English. Interesting that I didnt hear any Korean spoken. Im sure the staff are multilingual at this Korean restaurant. Good service.",

The bossam was a 4/5 for us. We\u2019ve had better but this is good for the short drive from home!",

Their garlic kimchi was so addicting too!\n\nParking is plenty, I appreciate how clean the tables and restaurant is inside, and the employees were nice.\n\nThe prices are a little high but lots of places are right now with inflation unfortunately."

      "This place is very good, i don't like that it's located in a shopping mall, we had a party of 7 but online they only allow 6,  we made reservations 2 days prior someone told us to come sometime before our 330 reservation and they'd accommodate us. However, once we arrived, they seemed inconvenienced to cater to 7, even though we put it online 2 days prior.\nThankfully, we didn't wait past our reservation time to be seated. We were served by Yanna, who made sure we were well taken care of the entire time of our visit.\nThe food is AMAZING!! I've never been here nor any place like it. We ordered many things across the board, and nothing disappointed us. The dessert is fabulous, so if you think you only want 1 order double, especially if sharing \ud83d\ude09 for a group of 7 we spent $645 tip included we also ordered 13 alcoholic drinks.",
      "Would have never tried a place like this but TikTok made me do it.   The menu is intimidating but thankfully I watched a few videos before arriving.  I went with family and 2 of them had been there before.  That was also helpful.  We ordered a lot of different items off the menu and nothing was disappointing.   I put the spicy sauce and spicy mixture on pretty much everything.   A total of 7 of us we paid 645.00.  We got many items and a total of 13 adult beverages.   I highly recommend this place",
      "I was so excited to finally try this place out because they are known for the famous Xiao Long Boa and I remember watching an episode where Anthony Bourdain went to in Taiwan and it was amazing! The wait is usually extremely long so I have waited until now. However, I was left so disappointed. We ordered many different versions of their Xiao long bao and what I was looking forward to that thin wrap around a hot pouch of soup with meat stuffing, but that was not the case that day. The wrapper was deliciously thin as known and I loved it. However, the Xiao long bao was barely warm and there was really no soup. Poked the bao to release soup and it was barely a sliver of soup, tired another one -popped the entire thing in my mouth and it was no soup! It was so dry! It was more dry that the cheap stuff I can get at the supermarket! I was so disappointed! The garlic green bean was pretty good, but nothing special. Pretty expensive for the size though.\n\nOverall, I was diaspponted. It was also pretty expensive for mediocre Xiao long bao. Maybe it was just a one off bad experience, maybe it was the location, maybe they have gone down hill since expanding, who knows.",
      "As with most other locations, the line was long but we were able to walk around the shops while we waited. Our favorite bites were definitely the spicy wontons and garlic string beans. If you like sweet and mochi texture then definitely get the chocolate Xiao long bao."

      "Came here for a friend birthday, they have good selection of skewer items, and a verity of Chinese bottled beverages. The food is delicious, they cook at the back and bring it to you. I really like the tin foil clam and glass noddle, and special beef skewer. Plenty of parking in the plaza. Grilled fish is also very tasty, and can be made not spicy at all.",
      "AYCE Chinese dumplings and small dishes during morning and lunch time. The dishes are the traditional Northeast Chinese cuisine including tofu, pig ears, eggplants, pork rib, cucumber... The dumplings are verified with pork, beef, shrimp with napa cabbage or celery. One can DIY for specific needs like vegetarian requirements. Ones should cook themselves with the pot.  Easy to be full.",
      "This place is the only all you can eat AYCE dumpling restaurant I saw in San Gabriel. It's a small hole in a wall mom and pop shop and you can even see an elderly couple making the dumplings when you enter the restaurant.\n\nThe place is small. When I came in, no one spoke english. One of the waitress came with a translator machine and that was the first time I communicated with one of the staff. Someone came over and put a pot of boiling water on the portable stove on our table. We are given a big tray with ladle.\n\nThe dumplings are on trays of 8 pcs and I thought we have to grab each tray. I was wrong. I grabbed 5 trays of different dumplings so I got full adter eating 40. I didn't know that I need to use the BIG tray that is put on the table with a big ladle. You will use that tray to pick the dumplings you want from the freezer and put it on your tray. You will then boil these dumplings until they float. Wait for a few more minutes to cook the internal of the dumplings. There are also some appetizers like kimchi, eggplant, bean sprouts and fish balls on the other side of the freezer.\n\nThere are black, red vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, sesame oil and chili oil that you can mix for the dumpling sauce.\n\nThe dumplings are delicious and fresh. We tried their beef, shrimp and vegetable dumplings.\n\nThis place is worth it if you have the big appetite to eat dumplings. But they have a limit. Only 1 hour for AYCE dumplings.",
      "They are serving AYCE dumpling here!\nIt is pretty interesting! And very affordable!\nThe appitizers are also included. They even give away toy bears!",
      "I heard about this place from my mom and wanted to try it. I\u2019ve always loved skewers and this place had it all. We got lamb, beef, potato, and they even have fried bread (super delicious!) they also have mains like fried rice and innovative dishes like grilled cold noodle. The only thing I wish I could have done is take advantage of their drink specials!"

      "This might have been the quickest meal we've had in months. We had the traditional minced pork noodles, the peeled chili pork dumplings, and the coriander pork dumplings. All of which were good. We also enjoyed their \"hot and spicy sauce\" (it was a bit like a fermented chili paste) and their chili oil, which was dark and a bit smoky. Everything was flavorful and the service from the waitress was friendly and fast.",
      "Their stewed beef noodles were very delicious. The beef was well cooked and flavorful. The broth was tasty. The service was good.",
      "Delicious beef noodle soup.  You can taste the rich flavors and the time preparing the soup base.  The noodle is not the common wide noodles used in other beef noodles.\n\nThe side dishes are decent and served warm, though I personally prefer serve cold.\n\nWe tried the stinky tofu which comes in its soup base.  It is not deep fried which makes the fermentation flavor stronger and actually more effort to enjoy.",
      "Authentic Taiwanese beef noodle spot. Perfectly balanced soup with tender beef. It\u2019s right next to the famous Lan Zhou noodle house so it was honestly a little hard to find at first. But it\u2019s literally right next to it so it\u2019s easy to miss.\n\nWe ordered the braised seaweed, egg, bean curd and garlic cucumber as a starter.\n\nWe got the premium beef noodle and just a regular beef noodle. I would recommend the premium more just because it has some tendon on it so it makes it even chewier and for some reason the meat with tendon so much juicer and softer.\n\nI thought the soup base was very well balanced. Often times you can taste either the grossed pack more or the soy sauce but this one was right in the middle and hit the sweet spot. They also have the clear broth beef noodle so I will def try to get that next time as that is a little more difficult to perfect in flavor.\n\nWe also go a side of stinky tofu which was also super good. For those risk takers out there this is Taiwans fermented tofu and it\u2019s def acquired taste. But for those who like stink tofu I would highly recommend it!",
      "The noodles will heal your weary soul. Excellent texture and perfect spice level. The staff is attentive And friendly. Thank you"

      "The atmosphere and decor are awesome, and the service was outstanding. Plenty of dining space inside and in their covered patio, and the bar is cool. Food was prepared and served very fast the presentation was beautiful. Salsa and guacamole were good an tradtionally prepared. Flavors in the main dishes were a bit lacking for me - the tomato sauce for my steak ranchero was good but primarily a mild tomato sauce. Beans were lacking flavor (maybe because I asked for no cheese and that's where the flavor is) and quite runny. Shredded beef inside the tacquitos was tasty. Would have liked fresh tortillas rather than pre-packaged ones. Overall it was a decent lunch and I'd recommend the place for the service and decor alone.",
      "I don't know -- maybe it was just us when we visited (a sleepy Monday after the lunch rush hour), but the server or the kitchen got a couple of the orders for our party of 9 incorrect, despite coming back after taking the orders to verify each of our orders. My soft tacos were on the mushy side, the enchilada sauce was somewhat sweet, and the rice (normally a highlight for me at Mexican restaurants) was mushy. The inside was also rather dim. Again, maybe it was just me or the particular time of day, but just trying to call it as I experienced it.",
      "Love it here! Taco Tuesday is the best deal. Crispy Chicken Taco or 2 Street Tacos with rice, beans, and your choice of a beer or margarita for $12. Can't beat it! Friendly and attentive staff. Full menu also great, and love their margaritas.",
      "Ordered salmon w/broccoli/cauliflower, white rice with butter wine sauce.  So yummy !Chips and salsa were nice and hot. Chicken \ud83d\udc14 mole enchiladas looked great too.  I will definitely go back there to eat !",

      "The food here was amazing!!! Super affordable price!! I\u2019ve tried most of the food here. Plus, the food itself will take you back as if ur eating in Myanmar. The service was fast and very friendly. Highly recommend to anyone!!  Definitely gonna come back again !!!",
      "Enjoyed their Royal Tea-Leaf salad. Always get this dish at any Burmese restaurant. So many great fresh flavors and textures once all mixed up together.\n\nBeef Briyani was a favorite of my wife. Paratha was light, crispy, and quickly devoured by my kids while still warm. Had to try the Mohinga, unique to Myanmar tradition. All food with comforting home-cooked feel and nicely balanced.\n\nNew owner and staff accommodating and friendly. Kept prior Japanese menu so now can travel thru East Asia to South Asia with their varied offerings representing the entire wide region all in one restaurant.",
      "Must eat here if your looking for a delicious place to eat sushi rolls. Service is great, portions are generous. They didn't have crunchy roll in the menu but they made it for me. Just opened like a couple weeks ago so they have 50% off on most food. Highly recommend.",
      "We were a bit nervous about trying Burmese food for the first time but the server was very kind, and explaining which items he liked. He gave us time to think about our orders, and came over once we rang a little bell at the table (neat idea!). The food was excellent! I got some garlic noodles with chicken and it was so damn good. My dad said the teriyaki chicken was the best teriyaki he has had. My brother loved his beef curry and my mom enjoyed her coconut noodle soup! They did have to do some replacements since they ran out of ingredients but that makes sense since it was so tasty! Wonderful experience, would be back and wishing this restaurant success "

      "Our dear friends of ours recommended try out the food at Cabrera's Mexican  restaurant in Arcadia.   This is our first time at the restaurant our friends told us the food is amazing good and also their alcoholic drinks   were awesome they say.     We came to the restaurant  at Friday night it kinda pack full of customers enjoy company with friends  and having with a great time.\n\nWe got seated right away and one of  waiter hand us the menu and also got our drinks order.  We look at the menu and decided to order the two.or three combination plate.   My order the two item combinations a taquito and a chili renello and I order the three item plate comes with two hard shell chicken tacos and a chili renello.   Then waiter brought us our meal it looks very good then I took some bite of the bean and rice full of flavors in both items the beans have great flavors with cheese  amazing and rice season well with spice that make rice full of flavor.\n\nThe chile relleno was one of the best chile relleno I ever eaten.   Throught years I have tasted many version of chile relleno but this chile relleno have so much flavor in one bite.  The hard shell chicken tacos were very good crunchy I enjoy it.   My wife enjoy her meal very much.    Our waitess was very  friendly and also  the staff of the restaurant.    When check with Yelp I received a free flan it was so good we enjoy..",

She was very kind to get me a herbal tea bag for my lemon \ud83c\udf4b tea. I really needed a hot tea. I was very pleased. The price is understandable and fair. If I remember correctly, it was around $50 for 2 people. I would come again with friends or family."

      "Came in on Saturday for a quick and simple bday dinner. Turns out our server Kaitlynn made it exceptional with her professional and friendly service!! It was a pretty busy Saturday around 9:40pm and the majority of the restaurant were seated with customers. Kaitlynn still went to all her tables and greet/check on all her customers. She came over apologizing for such a wait and got our orders. We ordered our usual, Avacado Egg Roll, Couscous Mac and Cheese Balls, Prime Rib, Clam Chowder, Strawberry Dream and etc. As soon as we finished ordering, our soup and drink had already arrived. I never experienced such speedy service at any other BJ's before. However, as we were finishing our soup, our Prime Rib dinner came before our appertizer (which was confusing but we were hungry and didn't care anyways!) Later, as we were finishing our Prime Rib, our appertizer came at the same time Kaitlynn came and checked on us. She noticed that our steak came before the appertizer and apologized for the service but we understand that it wasn't her fault anyways. It wasn't a big deal to us anyways as long as we get the foods we ordered. Later we got the famous pizookies and we got both the salted caramel and chocolate chunk. They were both amazing. Kaitlynn lighted a cute candle as she wishes me a happy birthday! At the end, she also wrote a happy birtdhay on my receipt!!\n\nI can't express how Kaitlynn made my day so much better with her cute, friendly and professional service!! She is one of the best server I had experienced at any BJ restaurant!! She pays attention to her guests and noticed all the little details! I rather drive a bit longer to have such an amazing experience than to save on commute time!! Again, thank you Kaitlynn for such an amazing experience!!",
      "Came on Tuesday for the $5 Pizookie deal. The \u201cfresh strawberries\u201d are frozen. You know when you get fresh cut fruit and they have the taste like the onions or vegetables that were chopped on the cutting board before? That\u2019s exactly how they tasted. Maybe the chefs didn\u2019t wash their hands or the cutting board but it was not pleasant. The cookie in the pizookies are all not fully cooked. Very gummy, soft, and undercooked. Not many people in the late afternoon and there is a free parking lot. They have a bar with the games playing. We were greeted walking in by staff. Our server was alright. Nothing extraordinary. He did let us know that if we signed up on the BJ app, all our pizookies would be free though so we did take advantage of that deal. Overall very underwhelming experience.",
      "Such a great place to dine at.  Our waitress Anastasia was so wonderful and made some great food recommendations. I would definitely recommend the avocado rolls and their soups!",
      "Our server Marie, was amazing! Very attentive and friendly. Brought the correct orders and continuously asked us if we needed anything. Food was delicious! Would definitely come back again!",
      "We ate dinner here tonight. This place stays busy but the wait is not long. Looks like a good place to watch a game, get drinks and food.\n\nI had their Weekend Prime Rib dinner. It comes with soup or salad and 2 sides dishes. I selected their Garlic Vegetables and a baked potato. The Prime Rib was a very nice cut - very tender, tasty and good size portion. I\u2019d order it again, it also included their Pazooki for desert. $35\n\nMy son had the Fish & Chips (he said it tasted good) but to me: the 4 small/medium fillets were pretty thin and a little over done (in my opinion) My son liked it so that was all that mattered.\n\nMy daughter had there Lemon Chicken breast served over mashed potatoes with a side salad. She enjoyed it and said it had good flavor.\n\nWe had a nice server who was attentive and knew how to run her station. If you are in the area and want a variety of food choices and drinks - then stop by and visit."

And it was still crisp when I got home.\n\nFor vegetarians, the tofu katsu is really good and also a big portion.",

I had the pork tonkatsu with curry. Huge portions and so good.  I actually thought I was a bit pricey bit after I saw the quality and portions, I reconsider.  Also, not a   Bricks and mortar saves a bit.\n\nI think the key is to get a bunch of people and order two or three items from each stall. The choice are fantastic.",

      "One of the best chicken katsu in the area. The pieces of chicken are a decent size and flavorful. The prices have gone up over time, but the flavor she size of the meal hasn't.",
      "Quick Summary\nLocated inside the H-Mart food court, this curry spot is pretty good, but the excellent boost rating is for the super large portions. Easy parking in the H-Mart plaza\n\nFood- 5 stars\nOrdered the pork curry katsu. Food was pretty good and standard. But they probably gave the largest portions I've seen at a curry katsu spot. Extra star for the large portions\n\nService- n/a\nFast casual restaurant where you order up front and pick up your order when the loudspeaker announces your order number. The public tables can be a bit grimy because there isn't someone who cleans hourly (appears only during closing time)\n\nBottom Line\nSolid curry spot with super large portions. Come in hungry or prepare for leftovers! Would recommend trying multiple spots in the food court and making it family style, so you can try a little bit of everything"

      "I used to enjoy having breakfast at Matt Denny's Restaurant because of the good food and friendly service. However, today's experience was quite disappointing. The waitress was rude and discriminatory. She served me coffee without a plate or spoon and didn't ask what type of coffee I wanted. I had to ask for cream separately, while other tables received warm and attentive service.The coffee was cold, the omelette was dry, the steak was overcooked and had an unpleasant smell, and the hash browns were very dry and tasted awful. This was a stark contrast to my previous visits, where the food and service were much better.

      "This happened on a Friday about 2 weeks ago. Matt Dennys has always been a favorite of ours. They started having entertainment in the patio. Some of the entertainment have a large following so they are packed! It appears that now the priority is the entertainment area. We came for dinner not interested in the music outside. We obtained a booth inside and after a while obtained a menu from a server who appeared to be frantic. The menu was snatched from us after a short view for use outside, they were short of menus. We waited 25 minutes for the server to take our order. She never came back. I had to go to the Manager and ask if someone could take our order. He said he would send someone over. After awhile the Manager came and said he had to take our order himself. We waited 45 minutes observing the food going out the door to the patio. Finally another server came by and told us she would check on our order. She never came back!! By 8:30pm (we arrived before 7:00pm) I told my boyfriend \u201cLet\u2019s Go!\u201d\nThe meal I ordered with hopes of eating a hour earlier was now too heavy a meal to eat at this hour. WE WALKED OUT. We did get our glass of wine \ud83c\udf77!  Matt Denny\u2019s has apparently taken on the hoards of people in the patio without the staff to handle that and the patrons inside. I hope they are making tons of money because that appears to be their focus. This was not the first incidence regarding  poor service but we wanted to give them another try. Not going back."

Well I can't imagine how we can eat there later in the summer when the weather is gonna go up to 90's-100's!\n\nWe order two drinks and two food this time:\n\nDrinks:\n1. The well-known drink here - Ovaltine Volcano. Taste exactly like what we had when we were little. Sweet and creamy!\n2. Passion Fruit Green Tea - I had it less sweet less sugar. Perfect amount of sweetness and very tasty.\n\nFood:\n1. Udon Carbonara - Very creamy and greta taste. It's just the size is smaller then a usual dish. But I think with the price you pay, this is valuable.\n\n2. Ebi (shrimp) Katsu Sandwich - The shrimp Katsu is crunchy outside and juicy inside. The white bread they use is not like those store bought loaf bread. Very soft and milky.\n\nA very cute Japanese Fusion place. Very reasonable price without lowering the quality. I would recommend this place to anyone.",
      "This place is a gem! The owner came out and talked to us, he was so sweet with my daughter. The food is fantastic!\nWe ordered tempura Udon sooooo yummy!!! Tempura and chicken wings were fried perfectly. The teriyaki beef bowl is so yummy! The rice soaked up just the right amount of sauce. All the drink options were awesome, the Thai tea is great. 10/10 recommend this place."

      "The restaurant was a bit warm for such a hot day and all the grills on high.  The server was kind, as was the chef.  The food was good.   The soup was extremely tasty. Nice night out.",
      "Came here for an early dinner. Colleague and I were the only ones there, and we got a teppenyaki show all to ourselves. I ended up getting the chicken and shrimp combo. It was a decent teppenyaki. Portions were not as big as what I'm used to at a teppenyaki. I typically have enough for left overs for what I pay. You get rice as part of the meal, but noodles are extra charge. Overall this restaurant was very good."

Atmosphere was very relaxing. Female staff is cute, amiable and professional. Prices were economically high. Service was on point.\n\nOverall, I had a good order experience. I recommend it.",
      "Went with a friend to check this place out for happy hour yesterday. It was Wed at 5pm and the bar area was very low key and mellow. It got busier as time went by. There were two bartenders and service for drinks and food was okay. Enjoyed the popcorn tempura appetizer the best (we tried them all). I had the fuschia fascinator and it was good. They didn't have the apple tart available though which was a bummer. However would go back."

      "Loved the barn! Had a lifechanging stinky tofu dish and haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it three days later. The sweet potato fries were drizzled in honey yummm\n\nLots of vegetarian options! Attentive servers! All around great experience",
      "The beef noodle soup is absolutely terrible. They literally dumped a jar of Sichuan sauce in there, you could see a thick layer of the sauce, tingles to your bones.\n\nThe skewers are amazing, everything from the seasoning to flavor to quality of meat is PERFECT. they also have wife selection of drinks to choose from.\n\nService is a little non caring, have to wave them over for anything.",
      "The food is absolutely delicious no doubt about that. Very cultural. I'd recommend trying the smoked chicken heart and fish chin. The service was very friendly and helpful. Very nice staff. The staff was very concerned about their food quality which is always nice. They were willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs.  definitely give this place a try",
      "Tasty and delicious. Really like this place, Japanese drinking foods. My favorite dish is the crispy pork intestine. Also the yakitori is on point and highly recommended.",
      "Don't really understand why so many people lined up for it. The taste of food is around average and some of the dishes was super salty that we had to drink lots of water to dilute it. Beef tongue is not really authentic JP yakitori style but the Korean BBQ AYCE style that cost $10 for around 6 pcs? With the price and food quality, I don't think this is worth the money."

We have over 10 people, seniors, kids, and adults.\n\nWhat I love \u2764\ufe0f is being able to capture the memories together.  They took a group picture for us, printed it out, and gave us 5 copies, which we can share.\n\nNot taking about the price, we all love the onion soup \ud83d\ude0b,  it's so yummy.  The steaks, lobsters, scallops, and shrimps were all delicious.  It's very flavor, not so salty, but you can tell the texture has lots of garlic in it.\n\nIt's recommended if you're happening to be nearby.  It is the best location to be walking around the shopping mall after you're full.",
      "Came to celebrate my birthday and my daughter\u2019s birthday. What a great time we had Kayla took our order and Holly was our chef. The food and service were outstanding. The rice was cooked and seasoned to perfection. My steak just melted in my mouth bursting with flavor. The salad and soup are a must. The matcha ice cream is not too sweet but the perfect matcha flavor. Monica was super sweet and helped us too. The bathrooms are clean and plenty of parking. Ten out of ten totally recommend. Holly did an amazing job preparing our food and entertaining us. Wonderful location to celebrate.",
      "Our chef Chris was extremely nice and entertaining. It\u2019s like you get a 2 in 1 food and entertainment! Chris was making the table Wow and had even the kids entertained. Service from him was great he was very attentive. I had the filet mignon and chicken with fried rice and it was a 10/10! Be sure to ask for spicy mayo sauce on the side you won\u2019t be disappointed. I will be coming back and asking for the same chef. Our server I believe his name was Edwin, refilled our drinks constantly and also refilled sauces quickly! No complaints here!!",
      "The Chef Kevin was awesome. Great show.\nThe menue was also great. Prices have been ok.\nBut the time betrays the check in and the final placing at the table is absolutely unacceptable. We\u2019ve had to wait 1h and we had a reservation.",
      "It\u2019s been a decade since I\u2019ve been to Benihana and the experience is amplified by the cook and the company that you are sat with. We got a good cook bad company. Food was good, but the wow factor is the theatrics from the chef."

      "I always order a restaurant's specialty as-is, and this was no exception. I chose the chef's choice bibimbap, which was labeled as the best KBBQ bowl of 2017. I thought the beef bulgogi and kimchi pork paired very well with the rest of the dish.\n\nThey also have a beef ramen deal going on for about $8+tax. I ordered it and I\u2019m pretty sure the noodles are just instant ramen. However, it does come with a side of rice, cucumbers, and kimchi, so it\u2019s a good amount of food for that price.\n\nThe restaurant was dark and quiet, despite the presence of several groups of people. It was also a bit warm so I decided to eat outside. The restaurant is located right in front of the playground, so if you can tolerate the screams of 20+ children, you can enjoy your meal outside like I did, haha.",
      "Located in the promenade area just outside of Macy's. I go here anytime I'm in the area. You get a ton of food for the money and it all tastes amazing. Especially the bulgogi and kimchi pork! Highly recommended. They can be a bit understaffed at times, so just be patient.",
      "My new favorite spot for a bowl! The woman who worked there was so helpful and incredibly nice. It was my 1st time here and she was offering me so many delicious samples! The flavors of the beef, sauce was so tasty. I will be back :) I created my own bowl and the serving size is huge! Tastes so fresh",
      "We love this place simple, fresh ,good prices , different choices \ud83d\ude0bthe spice tofu is so good also to mix with the grilled chicken the green sauce mix is great.",
      "Pretty good Americanized Korean food. Pick whatever you want from base to protein. If you don't like it, it's your fault because you chose your mix. Tastes very good and probably would come back every time I come to this mall."

      "I really wanted to love this place! Especially since we picked this place to have our mother\u2019s day brunch!\n\nService: they demand 21% gratuity _ I wouldve expected their service to be better. We waited a long time even to get a glass water. It took even longer for our drinks and ten times longer for our actual meals.\nThere was only one waiter and no one else checked on us.\n\nFood: for starters we have the avocado toast. This made my husband and I so sick!\nMy stomach started hurting and thankfully we live 5 minutes away, I had to rush to the bathroom. My husband hasnt left the toilet in over 20 minutes\n-main course: Karaage chicken and ube waffles - chicken did not taste fresh, it tasted like reheated chicken and there was NO ube taste in the waffles and barely any fruit\nChilaquiles - it looked like nachos with two sunny side up eggs\nAmerican breakfast- nothing special just scrambled eggs and potatoes and bacon\n\nDessert: a mix of cakes and pastries - the kids loved it of course but I didnt care for it that much\n\nOverall it was not worth $350 especially we were forced to pay $50 for tip\n\nWe will not be returning. I\u2019m still sick from brunch",
      "Came here for brunch. Food was excellent! Drinks were amazing (both mock and alcoholic). The gelato was good too! I would recommend the trio sandwich and the poke and hamachi. The charcuterie board was good too.  My wife and kids loved all the cheeses on that board.  Meat and fig jam was good too.  The coffee was excellent too.  Steak was good, but on the thin side. Overall no complaints.  I would definitely come back.  I also recommend all the mock drinks, they were all tasty.",
      "We had mixed feelings about Melange. The place is gorgeous. Our waitress was really great and couteous. The food was hit and miss and took quite a while to arrive. My fish and dumpling dish was great but the steaks for our colleagues were very over done versus the medium order. They have a very good matcha basque cheese cake. Overall it could be better.",
      "Updating for the High tea and Highballs experience!\n\nWonderful tea time! The service was attentive, the tea was great, we had the earl grey , jasmine and oolong. Two of us had the regular Chinese tea set, one had the hi-ball tea set that came with 2 cute little pancakes topped with caviar, which were delicious, and a very good tea-infused highball cocktail.\nGave the food 4 stars instead of 5 because of the scones, Devonshire cream, and mochi ball skewer. The vanilla and matcha scones looked lovely, but were crumbly, they fell apart when trying to spread the cream and lemon curd on it. Secondly, although the menu said there\u2019d be Devonshire cream, it was actually more like or butter, thicker consistency and not sweet. Lastly, the 3 mochi balls on a pretty skewer were not what was expected. They weren\u2019t actually mochi, they were dango, more densely packed rice balls that had the consistency of hard playdoh. We saw that other tables left only these dango balls on their tea tray as well. But other than these, the rest of the food was wonderful, esp the taro mochi , smoked salmon sandwich , lobster & egg salad sandwich , and shitaki mushroom with truffle aioli sandwich.\n\nWe had the DineLA menu and it was such a good value, at $55 per person! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was wonderful. I didn\u2019t post the other courses or dessert, they came out too blurry, but there were several courses , each one was fabulous. I\u2019d love to come back to try their high tea.",
      "I had a wonderful business dinner in their private dining room. It was a great place for it, it offered privacy yet had big windows looking down into the main dining room. The server was fantastic and the food amazing. High recommend the restaurant and if you need a private dining experience their 3 room are perfect."

While also mainting a high level quality. The projectors showing the visuals also improved the atmosphere along with the music.",

      "We visited in 2019. We were looking for a place to chill and have food and drink. We were new to the area and after asking around this place was recommended to us. The bouncer was nice but the nice experience ended there. We stood inside near the front for awhile and we were finally approached by a waiter. We let them know we were interested in a table. After waiting 10 minutes as staff passed us by we felt uneasy. It felt as if they did not want us there. It's funny reading the reviews the experience we were expecting everyone else seemed to recieve. We eventually left after feeling we were in a gangster bar and were unwelcomed guest. We were terribly disappointed.",
      "****!!! It's on the second floor of the parking lot stairs right next to Burlington !!!***\n\nSo I couldn't find the place so I spent some time just walking looking for it but once I realized to call and ask they picked up the phone right away and directed me and also took me even though there was just 20 minutes left ( I said please \ud83e\udd7a ) so I quickly ordered from the items available on the menu at that time and the staff was so nice and the food came out so fast and also they helped me charge my phone \ud83d\udcf1 I would totally come back and also everything is delicious I highly recommend the onion rings, gyoza, egg rolls , and shumai :-) goes amazing with Sapporo ( they recommended the beer)",
      "This place is amazing! Clean, organized and so much fun! Shout out to the entire staff for being professional, kind, and accommodating. My family and I had an absolute blast tonight.  The food was surprisingly fresh and tasty as well! This is the best karaoke venue I have been to in LA. Much more welcoming and fun than some sketchy places in Ktown. Their hourly and minimums are extremely reasonable. If you want to have an all around great experience, book one of their awesome rooms. Five stars for cleanliness as well! Thank you for a great birthday booking!"

      "This place has a big menu with various types of food from east to west as it is Hong Kong style. The food portion is big and the meat/seafood dish comes with a lot of protein. You can consider this place cheap given the amount of food. The server is nice and the food taste is quite decent - not super flavorful but moderate good flavor. The secret item we want to try is souffle. Yes the French fancy dessert! But it takes 45 minutes to make. So make sure you order that right when you enter the restaurant. I want to come back to try the souffle!",

The portion sizes for the prices are very large and reasonable. I would highly regret the mapo tofu, and the Angus Steak and Salmon or the Grilled Filet Mignon and Chicken Steak. Chicken wings and corn soup are also really good.",
      "Been here a few times.\nThe food is always good since HK Cafe, you can get breakfast even dinner time, with a lot of variety and blend of Asian and American foods.\nThis morning, it took almost 45 mins to get our food, and they got the order wrong on one plate, sent back, then the correct plate came out.\nOther than that, overall like the place and opens late in case in need of late night meal or snack.",

      "First off, let me state that I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience.\nThe two strongest points about this place are the extremely friendly service and the comforting time capsule feel of the place.\nThat being said, I found the star of my meal, the chicken pot pie, to be nothing truly remarkable.\nBefore I go any further, I don't like posting reviews that are not super positive unless I actually had a miserable experience, which I didn't.\nWould I return to this place?\nYes, absolutely!\nWould I drive all the way up from Long Beach to go here, probably not, unless I was meeting a like-minded person who enjoys time capsule dining as much as I do.\nYou get a lot of food for your money!\nThe side salad, which comes with green bean salad on top of it was actually quite tasty, though might be off-putting to some.\nThe dinner rolls were soft, delicious and melted in my mouth.\nI would probably try the chicken pot pie again, just perhaps with the gravy on the side.\nThe mashed potatoes are what really made me sad.\nI don't usually get snobbish about food, and I grew up with instant mashed potatoes, but these were really not enjoyable.\nMaybe it was just an off day for that batch of potatoes?\nI still ate them as I dislike food waste, but I would definitely avoid them next time.\nMy dinner even came with a choice of dessert.  I picked the rice pudding, which was excellent and my favorite part of the meal by far!\nIf I'm in the area again I'd love to try this place out for breakfast.\nYou can truly tell it is beloved by locals, and for good reason!\nMy only other piece of advice for the owners would be to change out the light bulbs for something a little warmer.  The cool white light bulbs they have in the majority of the fixtures really clash with the vintage 70s vibes, especially the ones over the counter!\nThis place has been going strong for 49 years. (Since 1975)\nI hope they keep going for another 49 at least!",
      "I was staying at a friends house and asked if any of his local places did proper wholesome food and he recommended here! He also said it was family run, which a major plus for me, as I like to support such places if I can.\n\nWe went along and after a fun chat with the waitress, placed our orders. We had soup and salad for starters, with absolutely delicious bread!\n\nThen we had Beef Pot Pie, with mashed potato, greens and thick gravy (Just like back in the UK). I have to say, it was delicious and I never thought I'd be able to have a pie and gravy in the states, like back home.\n\nThis was all finished with ice-cream and I have to say the Mint choc chip reminded me of the equivalent Viennetta from home. The taste and texture, identical, which was good.\n\nOverall, the experience was excellent and the food hit the mark perfectly. I wish we had a similar place back in the UK near me.",
      "This place has been here for so long. It definitely stands out among all the Asian restaurants. It\u2019s got that old diner feel inside. My dad and I used to pickup their pot pies by the dozen and just keep them in the freezer. My first time actually dining inside haha. The staff are super nice and welcoming. Nothing beats having one of their fresh pot pies. I had the dinner plate with and extra pot pie\u2026I could\u2019ve done without the extra, but I loved it.",
      "This place was great.  Thw chicken pot pie was excellent. Our only regret was that they don't serve breakfast.",
      "Very comfortable family restaurant.  Food is good, dinner includes the entre, soup or salad, and side.  Best thing, it includes a dessert (couple of choices available). The chicken pie is great, the portion could be bigger (should have ordered the second pie for a little bit extra $)."

      "Was greeted with great service as soon as I entered the door. The clear communication and help provided by the servers was truly spectacular.\nI came before 5pm, so I was able to get the $2.99 meat trays. This amazing price is something worth coming here for along. The fried bean curd and sweet dipping donuts are also amazing.\nAll in all, this place deserves the best ratings possible on any app. This experience is unbeatable compared to any other restaurant in the United States.",

      "SOONHEENE is a very famous place in South Korea.\nI was so excited that I ordered most of the menu and everything was delicious! In particular, the mung bean pancake, rose tteokbokki, and donkatsu are fantastic. All the staff were friendly and provided good service as well \ud83d\udc4d",
      "Not a lot of places do Korean Street food, so this is definitely unique! The physical space is small and the parking lot of also small,  so good luck!\n\nSeat yourself after ordering at the counter.  Water is also self serve.  Disposable utensils and napkins are at the tables. Service was very fast and portions are fair.  The tteokbokki is nice and chewy. The fried chicken is probably the highlight of the menu,  it was super tasty and crunchy! The gimbap was my favorite, the best I've had in a long time.",
      "My wife and I are crazy about Korean fried chicken. Which this place opened near our favorite mochinut place, we knew we would have to check it out - and we were not disappointed! This place definitely ranks in the top two fried chicken places we've been to!\n\nWe had a whole chicken - half original and half with their special Onion sauce (slices of onion with an onion mayo dressing). The flavor of the chicken was delicious, flavorful, and was nicely crispy!\n\nWe also had their Rose Tteokbokki and Mayak Gimbap. The Mayak was really nice! The Rose Tteokbokki was absolutely delicious!\n\nEverything here is really good. Do know that the service was a little slow, but only because everything is made fresh to order. It's very much worth the wait!",
      "Loved the traditional mung bean pancake and Ttubboki! You can ask them to make your ttubbki mild spicy if you want. The oden soup was okay.  Nothing special. Mayak kimbop was decent. I prefer classic mung bean pancake over seafood one. Seafood one has only shrimp in it and it\u2019s more expensive. Service was okay.",
      "Got wings with hot and spicy sauce. And boneless chicken with yangnyum.\nThey were so good. The chicken was so crispy and juicy!! Price was reasonable too. They also have Korean street food inside, so we got pork meatball as well. I absolutely love this little neighborhood joint!"

      "Mo-Mo Paradise is a restaurant with excellent value for money, perfect for those wanting to experience delicious shabu-shabu and an all-you-can-eat buffet. In addition to unlimited meat, the restaurant offers a self-serve drink station and a variety of other self-serve dishes. A standout feature is the self-serve curry rice, which I enjoy every time I visit.\n\nI always order their beef chunk eye and beef short plate\u2014my favorites! The restaurant also has a free parking lot at the back, making it very convenient.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Mo-Mo Paradise!",
      "Meat is fresh and good quality. Price went up with 18% service fees. Kids love the noodle and udon. 0-4 years old is free. 5-10 is half price. Curry rice is good.",
      "Food:  Good\nPortions: Small\nPrice: fair\nService: Lagging, only come when asked\nAtmosphere: Simple Hotpot design\nAccommodations: Very little\n\nPros: the meats are fresh and soft cut into thin slices. The curry is very good. I love curry.\nCon: basically almost no sauce kiosk. No soy sauce or ponsu sauce at kiosk. You have to ask for it\nThe selection cart is very small. Only a few veggie choices and 2 types of meat balls. Very small selection.\nService are not great. Waiters only come when ask. Soups are almost dry, no one take the initiative to ask for refills.\nMeats are fresh, but very small portions, 4 slices in 1 tray. It's all your can eat, but still small portions. We ordered almost 50 trays.\n\nI have to say, I'm not a fans of this place. My 1st time in this place for my nephew's birthday. It was his choice. As a hotpot restaurant, this is poor in my opinion with a very small vegetable station. There are many other places much better with much larger selection and better service.",
      "The service was very smooth and our waiter was fun and polite. When ordering meat there is no limit per round and they will happily give you a whole stack of plates at once. For parties of six or more, there\u2019s an 18% service charge which is separate from the tip.\nThe meat is high quality, where the fatty cuts are fatty and the leaner cuts are rich in flavor. They slice the meat extra thin so it cooks in an instant, even the pork. The farmers market and sauce bar is pretty small though. I think other Momo locations have more options. Here, there wasn\u2019t even sesame oil or soy sauce.",
      "\u2728We perfected the art of meat twirling\u2728 at Mo-Mo-Paradise in Arcadia! With locations throughout Southern California and internationally, everyone can enjoy their traditional Japanese AYCE Shabu Shabu or \u201chot pot\u201d but with a modern twist.\n\nThey offer 4 choices of soup broth (Shabu-Shabu, tomato, tonkatsu, & Sukiyaki- this was our fave!), a wide variety of premium quality meat cuts served to your table, a farmers market that goes beyond just fresh vegetables & noodles, and the standout Drink Garden (sodas, milk teas, fruit teas, & toppings)\ud83e\uddcb"

      "This review is strictly for the $12.99 Shabu deal and the atmosphere. While it is a great and enticing way to lure customers into an inexpensive option for hot pot the portion size is very small and need add-ons for one to become full. I am very unhappy with the outdoor seating. Came here on a Sunday evening and was overwhelmed by mosquitoes. On top of that they dim the lights for whatever reason and was hard to see if the meat was cooked. The actual restaurant was used entirely for kitchen. Restrooms were nowhere to be found. I\u2019d still come back for their cheap shabu options but beware that deal is good for a light snack and not intended to keep you satisfied for long.",
      "Great place for shabu-shabu with reasonable price.  There were multiple soup flavor to choose from and a large sections of different type of meat.  The vegetables are free and you can always ask for more which is great to pair with the meat.  The servers are quiet and always friendly but at time it felt a bit rushed but I can understand given that there are tons of people waiting outside.  Will definitely come back again, but I think it might help if they have a reservation system.",
      "Used to come here before Covid and was pretty awesome all around. Stopped coming because service went down hill and there were so many other Shabu options around to try. Fast forward a few years and wanted to give them another try.\n\nThey are exclusively outside dining now. Good for us since we have a pup.\n\nMeat quality was good, not great. Sauces were also good, but have had some better Goma sauces at other establishments.\n\nMy gf didn\u2019t love her spicy miso (a little watery) but I enjoyed my fire crab broth. Probably because I was getting tired of the typical miso, tomato and konbu you get everywhere else. They also have Tom Yum, kimchee and a few other options so the variety was a pleasant surprise. I though the price was pretty reasonable as well.\n\nService was decent, but you do have to flag people down for extra sauce and water. Last but not least, we noticed they had the other garnishes like green onion and garlic at their base station, but didn\u2019t offer it unless you asked. Same with the spice drops. I asked for some and they wouldn\u2019t let me serve myself which was a little annoying.\n\nWe will be back because of the outdoor seating/pet friendly and broth variety. Service was good enough and we have a little experience under our belt for next time.",
      "Terrible outdoor service. Waiters were extremely slow, and they were just chatting around with each other near the entrance. It was not a busy night.\n\nIt took about 15-20 min to place our order, another 15-20 min for entrees to arrive, then another 10 minutes for appetizers, then 5 more minutes for a beer that we ordered 30+ minutes ago!! Yes, in that order.\n\nThe shabu tasted decent, however I did get sick later. And I never get sick from food (I have an iron tummy usually, lol). I\u2019d avoid the kokumi sushi roll.\n\nDefinitely will not return.",
      "Free refills on vegetables and reasonable prices. Very professional and friendly staffs. Great and tasty food with plenty of parking spaces. Also opens till midnight! You won't be disappointed picking this hidden gem."

Plenty plenty of leftovers!\n\nPortions are generous and food is very yum.\n\nService/Ambiance - Quick and friendly service! Just fyi, they charge 3% for credit card use. Other than that, we'll be back!\n\nParking - Located in a plaza with a grocery store. Usually not too difficult to find parking in the lot.",

Service is great, chef's were fun and engaging. Getting a Reservation is tough, but that's understandable for a location like this. Give it a try if you have a chance.",
      "Here is what we will definitely order again on the next visit\n1 Beef Tongue (Perfectly grilled)\n2. Yellowtail on top of steam rice (Fish is fresh)\n3. Grill veggie (Pumpkin is so good)\nThis will make a perfect dinner set with fish, beef, and veggies.\nDon't forget to  make a reservation as the seats are limited",
      "Amazing! The seafood was all really fresh, and everything was seasoned/cooked perfectly. Since the restaurant is izakaya style, the portions are relatively small, so expect to order more than one dish per person. This place is a bit pricey, but in my opinion, worth the money. In particular, their house-made black sesame ice cream is delicious.",
      "Absolutely love this Izakaya. This unassuming restaurant combines a relaxed atmosphere with delicious food. Tatsu-san (chef) is a hilarious character making your dinner experience that much better. Be sure to make reservations, because it is almost always booked. I usually order the beef tongue, sashimi platter, karaage and a few other dishes. Try this place out!"

      "Pretty amazing section style cuisine! The spicy beef noodle soup , Dan Dan noodles, scallion pancakes, and Xiaongnbao were among the very best we've ever had. Okay prices and plenty of parking. Give them a try, you will not be disappointed.",
      "Ordered beef rolls Shanghai style, Shanghai style pan fried noodle, and Steamed Shanghai style dumplings. The beef rolls were a cold style serving, 6 rolls of pretty good size. Beef to roll ratio was good, cilantro was not overpowering, and the hoisin sauce was a good amount (not overdone). If you prefer it served cold, these are great. The noodles were plentiful and the flavor permeated the semi-thick noodles quite well. The dumplings were fine, definitely enough to hit the spot or craving but not the top pick of the meal. Not too busy for a Sunday mid-afternoon, service was fast and easy.",
      "Came here twice and they still didn't disappoint. This time I brought my family to try their beef noodle soup out in the cold raining weather and they simply loved it. My kids kept reminding me to leave them a 5 star since they liked it that much \ud83d\ude02 So here it is \ud83d\ude09.\n\nThe food is delicious and the portion is very generous.

We tried quite a few things like the Tonkotsu Ramen (regular and spicy) the Tan Tan Ramen that was absolutely so delicious (my favorite) an order of Combo Fried Rice, chicken Karaage and the most delicious homade Yukinoya Gyoza! \ud83d\ude0d Everything was so good! Oh, we also tried the Okinawa Chasu... I may never order regular Chasu again. It was a great dining experience with a kind attentive wait staff that made for a pleasurable time there. We will definitely be returning soon. Oh, and thanking the cooks on the way out for a deliciously prepared meal and their smiles and responses of the kindess words was Priceless! I recommend this place 100%. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Many blessings and love!",

Will go again in the future.",

Plenty of free parking but a bit challenging finding a spot.\n\nRestaurant is clean with plenty of indoor seating.\nFriendly service but seem a bit understaffed.\n\nThey have helper robots that bring some items to your tables.\n\nMeat quality is good but a bit overpriced and portions are a bit less than what you can get at other kbbq places.\n\nThe reason we went here is because they accept reservations unlike other kbbq restaurants where it's first come first seated.\n\nIt was good, but for the price I'd go elsewhere.",
      "The ambiance exuded warmth, striking a perfect balance between cozy and vibrant. But the true star was undoubtedly the food. The variety of meats impressed, while the side dishes beautifully complemented the main course. The attentive and efficient service ensured our dining experience was seamless. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone yearning for authentic and delectable Korean barbecue.",
      "Came on Mothers day at about 430pm, place was somewhat empty but began filling up by the time we left at 6pm.  Korean bbq but with set prices for meats.  We ordered the small pork  which is a pretty good choice for 2 adults.  Got a side of Bulgogi from a la cart and some shrimp fried rice.  All were amazing.  Waitress kept coming around to help flip the meat.  Got a pint of Sapporo for 3.99 which is a good deal.  Men's bathroom only had 1 toilet and 2 urinalysis which was not enough since the dinning room has a large capacity.  Not bad, will come back to order beef package."

(as you can see in the attached pictures) We also ordered a bacon burger mayonnaise only that we received it doused in the garlic dip sauce. My son also asked for a cheesecake slice for dessert before we left and the waitress neglected to put in the order and brought us the check instead.

The day after I had a bad stomach ache and got food poisoning from it, been in bed last 6 days sadly, something was off about that dish. The food menu is massive here and they may have let quality slip with that dish. Also, the Chinese Chicken salad,  it was too much dressing on it and the mixer didn't match well. There are plenty of free parking and nice mall locations. The atmosphere is loud, but the lighting is nice. The dessert are more of what they are known for, so better to stick with ordering that like I did last time, then I would have not gotten a tummy ache. Waiter was nice, but he was super forgetful, entire experience was off this time."

However, as someone who looks forward to the numbing spicy of the cucumber salad, it just tasted like cucumber soaked in water .\n\nOverall, the chicken was good but not as tasty as Pasadena. As this location is much closer, we will definitely give it another try in a few months!",

This place is teeny and out of the way but the chicken and deep fried buns were soooo good, better than some of the other locations. The decor is nothing to write home about but I gave it 5 stars because the counter staff were so friendly, earnest, kind and really welcoming. They kept a tab open for us while we were waiting for our friends to join us which was a nice surprise. I think they just took joy in watching us enjoy the food."

They offer four sets and only $9.99 lunch specials(and come with 1 free drink) that are fantastic deals for trying more dishes.",
      "Got the combo a and b special. Pork and century egg porridge and beef rice noodle. Ok. Won ton noodle. Meh. Chow mein has not smoky flavor. Service slow",
      "Quaint little place you probably won't notice unless you walk by.  I love that they're open late. I got lo mein which was the traditional way of cooking it...dry noodles with the broth on the side. Not the typical western gross kind. Food was super fresh and hot. Excellent portion. Got a cold soy bean milk that was absolutely delicious. The place is clean and cute inside. Highly recommend this place \ud83d\udc4c",
      "Clean and comfortable sit down restaurant serving Canton dishes. Portions lean small but the prices reflect that too."

      "Randomly found this spot and was in the mood for dim sum, as usual. They had just opened when we arrived. We placed our order and were out within an hour. The prices are reasonable, especially considering the very good quality of the ingredients.

      "Pretty packed place!\n\nCame on a Saturday noontime and there was a line out the door!\n\nThankfully my relatives came early and got us a spot inside already. We had two big tables.\n\nI was looking around for a waiter cause we really needed water (100 degrees today) and I asked a worker nearby. He was awesome and brought water over after he finished the task he was working on!\n\nThe food was delish!!\n\nParking is plenty and there is even a shaded parking structure.\n\nI did see some flies roaming around but those are inevitable.",

Better call this restaurant before you place an order to make sure they are really open",
      "There\u2019re tons of dim sum Cantonese seafood restaurants in the San Gabriel valley area. While Chef Tony in Arcadia, on Michelin guide, and Harbor Seafood Restaurant in Rosemead, a Michelin star, are champions, they don\u2019t have the almond milk pastry which this restaurant proudly serves. It\u2019s exotic and delicious.",
      "I really like this place - food was excellent and service was fast.\n\nThey don\u2019t do carts here - you fill out a sheet and they\u2019ll bring out your order.\n\nParking lot is pretty big but shared with a bunch of other businesses.\n\nWe got tripe, Shu Mai, spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp balls and salted egg yolk custard buns (my personal favorite) - delish."

      "Pretty solid noodle house with yummy broth and a good variety of choices to order from. We ordered the Crabmeat Tomato Basil Noodles and House Special with Mixed Noodles. We thought the flavors were good and there was enough to take home for some leftovers. The place wasn\u2019t crowded before noon. This is our second time here and they have specials if you order over $39 worth of food and pay in cash you can get a drink included with your meal. Hope this place stays around. Parking on the street if it\u2019s available.",
      "Came to this restaurant already few times because the food are so delicious and fresh, especially the broth is so flavorful and not greasy at all. The meat no matter chicken or beef are moist and tender. We\u2019ve tried different kinds of rice noodle and rice with chicken leg, love it a lot!! The most important thing is that the amount of food are very large, it\u2019s hard to find other noodle at the same price better than this one. Also this restaurant is very clean and neat. Definitely worth to try, you won\u2019t regret it!!",
      "The most disappointed take out!\nThe store was recommended by a social media. I ordered No. 1 large.  The portion was small, and the chicken was so dry.  Also No. 5 large, it's the house special. The portion was small, but the quality is not good either.  The fish ball and beef ball were not tasty at all.\nI gave the store two stars as I hope the owner/chef be serious about the quality of the food.\nSorry, it's not a store I will come back and recommend to my friends.",
      "Came to this place with my wife for lunch today,  we ordered the Crabmeat Tomato Basil Soup (Bun Rieu) and Special Beef Noodle Soup (Pho Dac Biet).  Both soup base taste bland,  the Beef Noodle Soup has no beef flavor, it has the chicken flavor instead.  The Crabmeat Tomato soup has no flavor at all.   They only give the bean spouts and couple slice of jalepeno.  When I ask the waitress for some basil leaves and vegetables that supposedly come with the shoup and she said they dont have any and rudely pointed to my tomato saying that the vegetable.\nVery disappointed experience.  There is better options close by.",
      "It is definitely my favorite place to go for a weekday quick lunch. Food is super delicious and heathy and the staff is very nice, personable and trying to tailor its service to different customers needs. I am simply addictive to the tomato basil crabmeat noodle soup EVERY time and the salted plum with sparking soda is super refreshing and highly recommended too!!! Simply love this place!"

      "Outstanding service! Came here super early\u2026 between 4-5am I think\u2026 it was an Indian male working the drive through\u2026 got a Diet Coke and I\u2019m guessing due to the hour I was there, there was a wait for my food (honestly wasn\u2019t even that bad)\u2026 he handed me my drink and waiting\u2026 then he tells me \u201cdrink some\u2026 I can give you a refill\u201d with a smile\u2026 I respectfully turned it down but honestly out of the 25 years I\u2019ve been in the states, NEVER ever once did a person that works in drive through has ever offered me that\u2026 and I\u2019ve worked in restaurants for 10+ years as a server\u2026 as a server we have an 60-90 min to convince the customers we give great service\u2026 but this guy did it in an drive through (5 min max)\u2026 amazing customer service, the burger was really good too\u2026 definitely a fan of this place\u2026",
      "Got in for lunch and ordered the City Slicker & Fries. Plenty of flavor and hit the spot. Service was great; everyone was friendly and food came out quick. Loved the outdoor seating and all the other options on the menu...plenty of things I still wanna try. Drop in and explore!",
      "I was in LA for vacation & looked up places to eat near by, this was the first place to pop up. I checked out the reviews and pictures and decided to give them a try. My mind was blown! I ordered the grilled chicken melt and the parmesan fries. Both were so good and fresh. I also am big on presentation & how my food looks determines if I will eat it or not. The presentation of the food was also clean, and neat. I enjoyed my food so much, I went back the next day & I ordered the lunch box for $12 which was the best deal & really a ton of food for lunch. They're pricey, but honestly the quality of the food, presentation of the food, and customer service is what you're paying for! Whenever I am in town, I will definetly be coming back. (Pictured is my lunch box combo, no drink and I added cheese to the burger which came out to $14, still not bad for lunch; fries, 2 tenders, a cheeseburger, and a cookie, ranch for the tenders)",
      "Came here on the weekend cause the huge \"EAT\" sign in front caught my attention. Decided to check it out, and I'm not gonna lie it did not disappoint! We ordered some cheeseburgers, 1 order of chili cheese fries [good for two people to share], and a chocolate shake. The quality of the hamburgers was phenomenal! The chili cheese fries were amazing as well, they make their chili from scratch every day \ud83d\ude0b. We finished off with the chocolate shake, which was just as delicious as everything else. I highly suggest trying this spot out.",
      "Wish I had tried this place sooner. Truly one of the best double cheeseburgers I've ever had!! I ordered 'The Goat.' The cheese is generous and it's actually melted onto the meat not like other burger joints with that rubbery stuff. The burger was made to order very hot off the grill not warm but actually hot which was very nice! The buns go perfect with the meat. Very delicious I will definitely be back. Highly recommend if your looking for a delicious burger!"

The food quality was okay, nothing spectacular. The soup base bowls are cute as heck cause cat. I had the hot Mongolian soup base, it's okay, not great, but okay. Honestly, the Little Fat Sheep soup base packages at 99 Ranch are more tasty \ud83d\ude05 but it's a nice place to gather with a small group of friends and family!",
      "Great varieties of soup base to choose from.  Price per pot starting ~$15 and you can also add in any additional side (ex. seafood side: 3 pawns and 4-5 pieces of fish for $4.95).  The food is decent and the service is quick.  Staffs are friendly and attentive.  The decor is nice and clean.  Since almost all the booths and chairs have high back, it provides privacy.  Easy access to Parking and there's plenty of space. Recommended.",
      "Great food as always! Great selection of broths and sauces. I would recommend getting the satay sesame, it's so good! I always get the regular selections of veggies and meat but if your into all meat then you can get the t Rex for no extra cost. We got the thai spicy (very good! Not to spicy but just enough to get that burn) And the coconut (not very special, felt like it was just broth with some coconut cream poured into it)",
      "This was my first first visit at this hot pot spot. I can\u2019t believe I had never been here before. Not only was the atmosphere great but the food was just as delicious!\n\nThe staff there always made sure to check up on us if we needed anything from refills, to more beer and just to see how our meal was going.\n\nI will definitely be going back here more often.",
      "Update Feb 2018:\nRegular beef -> quality went down\nAmerican wagyu -> even better quality than regular beef but not melt in mouth. Little bit chewy\n\nPlease increase the beef quality!!\n\nUpdate Sept 2018: make sure get wagyu beef, it\u2019s worth it. Soft and tender. $22 for 6 oz or $25 for 9 oz\n\nDecent beef quality, many different kind of soup / broth flavors. Staff are friendly, fast service and decent price. Good location with decent parking space. Get early - otherwise waiting could be long time. We ordered t-rex - basically more meat slices than vegetables. Same price as regular order (more varieties of vegetables). Many different dipping sauces, you. An choose 2 at a time but if you don\u2019t like it just ask for different kind and they will accomodate you"

A little on the pricier side for Korean comfort food but the spicy pork bulgogi is the best I've had compared to a lot of places, including restaurants in K-Town. Also, the boneless beef short ribs were a little too dry and sweet compared to the bone-in ribs.",

I been going to this other Korean place since I was younger and this place I just tried with family actually topped them off. The food had the right amount of flavor. She refilled the side dishes and lord mercy I think ima have a Korean baby cause jesus... food is great. cute little place most definitely coming back soon when I get some cash. You should try coming to this place to eat worth a shot. You won't get exceptional service anywhere else let me tell ya*)",
      "More than just Pork!\nVery clean and nice dining environment. Service is friendly and good.\nParking is good.\nNot as busy as some other Korean restaurants in the area; therefore, less waiting time.\nFood is very good with lots of ingredient.  This past vist, one dish is a little on the salty side.  Otherwise its excellent.",
      "Clean, well laid out restaurant with reasonably priced Korean fare. It serves a small subset of traditional Korean offerings, but the emphasis is definitely more towards the fusion-y dishes. I got the kimchi fried rice with pork belly. Although the pork belly had bone in it, overall the fried rice was hearty and very tasty to the last scoop"

      "It's a pity we don't live closer! We stopped by for some takeout to eat at the Tesla charger during a road trip, and it was a real treat.\n\nThe cornmeal crust is incredibly unique and tasty, and honestly lends itself to a  pizza category of its own. It has a crunch to the outside, while remaining soft on the inside, and holds the pizza toppings better than any crust I've had. Not only the crust tho, the toppings were well put together and obviously fresh, this is truly gourmet pizza lover's pizza.\n\nMy wife is a pasta fanatic and had to try the pasta. We agree the components made by the resto (meatballs/sauce) were good, with the meatballs especially a standout. Tho the pasta noodles themselves were really average. She enjoyed it but prolly wouldn't get it again.\n\nLastly the homemade Zucotto cake was out of this world, definitely worth checking out \ud83e\udd24\n\nCan't wait to stop by again when passing through LA! Also made for great leftovers!",
      "Apologize to the kitchen for showing up 45 minuets before they closed but we had a great experience! The staff was welcoming and the food was awesome! They are very unique because they use a cornmeal crust which taste great and holds all the toppings way better than a standard crust.\n\nWill definitely visit again, thanks for the service guys!!",
      "When you only very rarely hive 5 stars, It\u2019s such a please to give this review. I feel so blessed to have been in this awesome little authentic pizzeria. All the staff were so so friendly, talkative, helpful and just so nice to be around. Their pizza was so so amazing. We loved the corn crust and cannot wait to be back there to try their salads, calzone, homemade meatballs and of course more pizza. It\u2019s also so cheap. Such places deserve to be known.",
      "The pizza is amazing.   Salads are OK.   The wait staff is young... and often more interested in socializing with each other than taking care of customers.   On my last visit our waiter forgot a number of things.   Including to put our order in with the kitchen.  We ended up being there for almost two hours.   And no one apologized.",
      "I will definitely be back for the works penne pasta! So good. There isn't much of an atmosphere, waiters are chill, they come around every now and then. But food is served hot. I wish they had a bigger wine selection, but they don't mind if you bring your own bottle. I'm not sure they have a cork fee. We did try the pizza. It was good, but the pasta was better."

The Rainbow roll has a beautiful assortment of seafood from tuna,  salmon, yellowtail, halibut and shrimp. Each piece had good texture, and was well portioned. The Ringo Roll salmon was very good and interesting using dried apple to add sweetness to the fish. The sweet shrimp was soft and beautifully presented with the shrimp heads being fried separately as the other half of the dish; alternatively the shrimp heads could be offered as part of a soup. The Yellow Tail Roll was also a good pick that was very smooth. The atmosphere is very relaxed and peaceful here with a gradual pace of traffic coming through here. There is a shared parking in the rear of the building that is ample enough.",
      "I was looking for a Japanese restaurant owned by a Japanese proprietor in LA. I arrived late, around 7:40 PM, and found only one table occupied. I hesitated to enter at first. However, right by the entrance, I saw numerous pictures of Olympian figure skater Mirai Nagasu on the wall, which reassured me. I ended up having $100 worth of sushi. Honestly, I have no idea how I'm going to sleep tonight with such a full stomach! While researching Japanese restaurants, I found that most cost over $100. It's quite a large amount of money. Ultimately, I spent the same, but you can adjust according to your budget. I recommend this restaurant.",
      "How could I say I love the restaurant here. Just after shopping at the shops at Santa Anita and searching for the restaurant nearby, it's the first and closest choice. The store is small and might be somewhat old-fashioned, but you could feel the warmth. The decorations are specially designed while the staff are welcoming. The chef responsible for the sushi bar could always talk with the customers sitting at the bar. We ordered the recommended Salmon sashimi, it's fresh enough. The seafood Hotpot is rich in taste and the fish inside might be cod of great taste. It's also a special hand roll of scallops topped with grilled cheese. That's great and might be with the locals' taste.",
      "Very authentic Japanese sushi! The quality is so nice and the price is very reasonable. My personal favorite is their Unagi, squid, and yellowtail. All the fish are super fresh, they are selected by the owner every morning from the fish market.",
      "The space? Good \u2014 small, neat, clean.\nThe owners? Great \u2014 pleasant, caring about the place, professional.\nThe food? Amazing \u2014 fresh, flavourful, delicious!\nYou won't find many sushi places with THIS quality for THESE prices."

      "Food is great. Price is very reasonable. Wait time was not that long but it was kind of hard to get a hold of someone to ask for napkins. It is an open food court type of environment and lots of people walking by.",
      "Extremely fast service, fresh noodles, and other dishes. Korean BBQ on rice is excellent. Try the scallion pancakes. Great ice teas. Located in \"Food Alley\"",
      "We moved through the wait list fairly quickly for a table for 4 on Black Friday @ 6pm.  Total wait time was less than 30 minutes.  We were seated along the walkway between Noodle Street and DTF.  I really wanted to like this place but I think I don\u2019t like the large, open concept/layout and exposure of this restaurant.  I found myself keeping an area on our personal belongings and shopping bags since we felt \u201cexposed\u201d and didn\u2019t want to let our guard down.  The service was quick and efficient with the servers on point to take your order and get things moving.\n\nThe soup noodles came quickly followed by the appetizers which was ok since we just wanted to fill out bellies and get out.  The knife cut noodles are nice and chewy which I liked but some may think it\u2019s undercooked since it\u2019s not your normal springy noodle.  That kind of where the good parts end.  The other parts of the dish were just ok, nothing that knocked my socks off.  The beef in the spicy beef noodle soup wasn\u2019t as tender as I\u2019d like and was slightly on the dry side except for the pieces laced with tendon.  The tomato sauce ok (my friend did not finish and opted not to take the leftovers home).  Without leeks and The signature beef and cilantro, the signature beef noodle soup was left colorless!  You do need it!!!  Appetizers - cucumber salad was crispy and refreshing but not any better than those found at other restaurants, we found the fried calamari over fried and too chewy and wasn\u2019t dazzled by the scallion pancakes.  I think if this was the only place with available seating and I was starving - I\u2019d go back.  If not, I\u2019d pass on a return trip.",

      "Kai ramen is nestled in a plaza with JJ bakery, phoenix boutique and other stores. The parking lot is shared with other business and can get busy during lunch hours.\nIt is a small store with beautiful graphics on the walls. Although there was only one server, she was attentive and friendly.\nScan a QR code for the menu and order with the server. Food came out quickly. We ordered the kai white ramen(which was labeled as award winning) and bomb ramen. The kai white ramen was flavorful and had a buttery-ish taste to the soup base. The noodles are thinner compared to the bomb ramen. The bomb ramen had thicker noodles and a lot of flavor from the minced pork. The oil and salt levels are adjustable. They have a variety of broth flavors to chose from including tonkatsu, chicken and shoyu.\nThe spicy tuna crispy rice was interesting, and the rice was really crispy. The pork chashu buns had thin slices of chashu topped with lots of spring salad, which makes it easier to bite through.\nThey also have a vegan soup option and rice bowls if youre not feeling ramen.",
      "\u2728Anyone else slurp their noodles?\u2728 Our cravings for ramen certainly were satisfied at Kai Ramen, located in Arcadia, California and deep in the SGV. During the height of the pandemic, I found myself relying on @kairamenarcadia as my go-to for those delicious Japanese noodles in soup form.  Then on my recent dine-in visit, I realized the quality and taste of the meals simply was the same\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n\nI was finally able to try their Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice after all these years and it did not disappoint!  More happiness was activated with each bite\ud83e\udd70\n\nWe had: \ud83c\udf63Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice, \ud83c\udf57Chicken Cutlet Bun (chicken katsu in steamed bun mixed with cabbage, slices of cucumber, served with spicy mayo), \ud83c\udf5cKai White Ramen (salt base, skinny noodles, garlic butter, pork belly, flavored egg, scallions, crispy onion, kikurage), \ud83c\udf5cMaesoba Ramen (thick noodle, house special ground pork, scallions, mild soy based smoke flavor, imami fish powder, garlic, seaweed), and\ud83e\uddcbBoba Ice Milk Tea",
      "The place is very relaxed and cozy.\nThe service was good, except the dumpling took almost half an hour to serve after we finished the ramen bowls.  But nevertheless the \ud83e\udd5f\ud83e\udd5f were really fresh and delicious.\nThe volcano ramen was really spicy with the freshly cooked pop corn chicken on top making an excellent combo.",
      "I love ramen places specially the ones that are further out the city. But I noticed this place and thought to give it a try. The location is nice, plenty of parking. The inside is clean and staff are nice. So I ordered a kai Yellow and a classic tonkotsu ramen. Kai Yello comes with cheese and corn with pork belly slices. And chives. But I will say, this cheese wasn't authentic cheese. It was more of that processed shaved cheese already pre-packaged. You could just taste the Cleese and know right away, how powdery it taste. I really don't know any other way to describe the flavor of processed cheese but it did take away the flavor of the broth. Had they used natural shredded sheese it would be on point \ud83d\udcaf.  And for a dollar more really doesn't feel authentic. But the classic tonkatsu ramen was amazing. Comes with mushroom egg pork belly and chives too. I just hope they can improve on the food quality. The portion size is perfect though. And I also ordered gyosas and they were great.",
      "A nice ramen place but I found that the dumplings are the best item I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s very fresh, unless frozen dumplings in most restaurants. The meat inside was very delicious. The ramen was ok, I had the award winning ramen but couldn\u2019t figure out which award they won. The server didn\u2019t know anything either. It\u2019s worth a stop by for dumplings though!"

The udon curry was exceptionally good, with perfectly cooked noodles and rich, flavorful curry sauce.The service was outstanding, especially from a blonde-haired lady who helped clean up when my baby cousin spilled water. Her kindness made our visit special.I highly recommend Dashiwa Ramen for its delicious food and excellent service. We'll definitely be back!",
      "Can't go wrong with eating Ramen here.  Had the two Pepper Red tonkatsu ramen.  Delicious.  It was recommended by the wonderful waiting staff.  Since I had also showed up during Happy hour.  I ordered the premium large Sapporo Beer for $8, small is $6, but worth the price.  For an extra $2, got the chicken Karaage.  Juicy dark meat chicken with a few tempura battered onion rings that tasted good with beer.  Overall, great place to visit and enjoy the wonderful J-Pop and K-pop music playing in the background.  Thanks for making my hour dining experience very Happy. Ill be going back for the chicken cutlet cury next time.",
      "Love love love it here. The service is always great but the food, even better!\nFlavors are always strong and super tasty.\nWe've tried several ramen places in the area and this one has been the best by far.\nHave tried all their ramen bowls and they've all been great.\nI'm not even a fan of miso but their spicy miso ramen is so tasty.\nThey also torch their chasu and its so good!\nGreat smokey flavor and the charred edges are the best part!\nHighly recommend! Bring your friends!",
      "I\u2019ve tried all of the ramen and I haven\u2019t had a bad dish yet. The noodles are always perfectly cooked and the soup flavor is better than anywhere else. I recommend getting the tonkatsu black ramen or the beef curry with udon. Amazing food for a reasonable price. I always leave here full.",
      "We ate here after not wanting to wait for BJs and we were blessed because IT WAS SO GOOD!! The garlic edamame was salty and crunchy in the outside with fried garlic. The best I have ever had. We each ordered something different and they all slapped so effing hard after a day at the Ren Faire. And the prices were good too. The service was either sisters or twins and they were so quick! Order the the item from the giant pict. Can't remember the name but it's their specialty. Shout out to the the gyoza and karate chicken which were crunchy and delicious."

      "This place is comfort food to the max. It is so homey and delicious, offering traditional Taiwanese dishes. The sausage was super tasty and one of their signatures. Pretty affordable too with good value and good portions. The staff are very nice and speak both English and Mandarin. The interior is a bit run down but does not take away from the quality of the food.",
      "With its understated atmosphere and compact tables, this gem invites diners on a culinary journey through Taiwan, delivering an authentic experience from start to finish.\n\nWhen we walked into La Sin Bala, the cozy environment immediately caught our eye. With limited seating and neatly arranged tables, our anticipation was at its peak as we perused the menu, eager to sample a selection of Taiwanese delicacies.\n\nOur culinary exploration begins with the typical rice, elegantly presented in the style of a traditional Taiwanese bento. Every bite of tender and juicy pork paired with fragrant rice made us feel like we were in a buffet restaurant in Taipei.\n\nNext we had the oyster omelette, a dish that really stole the show. Egg rolls are full of Taiwan's unique flavor, a famous night market snack, harmoniously blending plump oysters with delicious eggs and indispensable vegetables, a perfect match with aromatic spices. Super authentic! A must order meal that left us wanting more with every bite.\n\nWe also indulged in chicken rolls accompanied by dipping sauce and a serving of shiitake mushroom and chicken soup, both delivering simple yet gratifying flavors.\n\nThese simple yet satisfying dishes are the perfect end to our culinary journey, leaving us feeling nourished and satisfied.\n\nOf note, the highlight of our experience was undoubtedly the oyster omelette, a dish that encapsulates the essence of Taiwanese cuisine. Its authentic flavors and affordable prices highlight La Sin Bala, making it one of the must-go places for food lovers looking for a taste of Taiwan.",
      "Very yummy vegetable dumplings and a wide selection of desserts. I got the iced grass jelly and it was delicious. Definitely a place to experience Taiwanese food",
      "great Taiwanese comfort food\nOur favorite:\n- Taiwanese Sausage (a la carte or meal)\n- Pop Corn Chicken\n- Pork Chop rice\n- Shaved ice\n- Steamed dumpling (15 minutes wait) not as good as DTF but it is good\n\nMost of their food is great.\n\n$20 minimum for credit card purchase",
      "Food/Taste/Flavor: 5/5 - came for an early lunch so there were plenty of tables available. It was a delicious Taiwanese meal 23) Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was delicious with a very salty broth. It was great while eating the noodles but could not finish the soup afterwards.\n\n30) Popcorn Chicken was juicy and well fried. Nicely seasoned with flavors all the way to the center of the chicken.\n\n37) Sticky Rice was as expected. Well seasoned and flavored but a bit oily.\n\nAmbience: 5/5 - clean and more spacious than expected.\n\nService: 5/5 - friendly and quick. You do need to waive them down for anything needed as they don't check back on the tables\n\nValue for price: 5/5 - good food, quick service, reasonable price"

      "I missed that this place was located inside of the HMarket \ud83d\ude44. I\u2019m still looking for a replacement to New Garden (Hacienda Heights) Jajamien noodles. This was a good start.  A small storefront with a few other eateries sharing large tables. Noodles were thick and chewy and the sauce was meaty. I needed a little soy sauce and pepper to punch up the sauce but I love the shredded cucumbers on top.  Good start on my journey for good jajiang noodles.\n\nThe HMart is Asian market paradise with every food, snack , produce you can imagine.",
      "I was so surprised once I saw it got 4.9 on Google Maps, then I realized that only 8 reviews.  I will give it a fail score for this restaurant.  It is located inside H Mart, Arcadia, CA.  I love H Mart and always had something to eat after or before the shopping.  I had a spicy seafood noodle soup and fried sweet and sour pork stick set.  I have to say they are good-looking, they can get 4-star if the score is only by looking.\nBut the taste was awful, it's tasteless. The pork was only sweet without sour, even touch. And the pork stick is full of stalk but with a very tiny pork slice inside and also tasteless. The noodle soup was not spicy even not salted. The seafood portion was a very small and bad smell. My daily eating is very light salted, even though I still feel the foods were tasteless.  Can you imagine how bad the flavor is?",
      "Gosh the sweet n sour pork is terrible. Driest meat I\u2019ve ever taste. Seems like they fry the pork in advance and then just double fried it so the pork inside is super dry. The dipping sauce just takes like a watery, sour syrup. It doesn\u2019t have any flavor aroma. I don\u2019t know how people give this place four and five stars.",
      "Stopped by for some takeout as i was craving haha GM Yun or black bean noodles. Also needed some fruit, so i opted for Kyodong which is located in the HMart supermarket.\n\nFood and service was pretty good and was nice to be able to shop while your waiting for your food. One thing the Korean shops perfected is packing food to go and it was no different here. Neatly packed and in great shape when I got home. The noodles were tasty too, but I\u2019m used to getting some ground meat mixed in the sauce and there wasn\u2019t any in their version. Could have been five stars, but their version isn\u2019t cheap, so I expect to get a little meat at least. Glad I ordered a combo which included the sweet and sour pork, because I am not a vegetarian :). The combo is a great option when your eating alone cause buying the two items separately would set you back way over $30+. Was definitely enough food me with even some left over for about $27 after tip. The sweet and sour pork was also pretty good. You do get one side dish, yellow radish which pairs well with the dishes, just wish they had kimchi as well. All in all a great dinner which hit the spot, but will keep trying other spots for jajangmyun for the next time.",
      "Good:  great value (if take into account of California pricing), noodle was great.  Like the menu item#1 and #2.\nOpportunities for improvement:  went there three times.  At least two times, there were no other customers ahead of me, but the chef won't cook my food immediately, instead he took his time to prep/cook other things."

      "Nice food options. Really liked their appetizers. Ordered veggie pakora and chicken tikka along with naan / curry. Nice food options",
      "We tried their lunch buffet on a weekday, it\u2019s $20 per person. They have plenty of dishes if you like chicken, but no much options for vegetarians.\nWish they had vegetarian options. It would be great if they can add samosa & 1 paneer dish to the buffet (will come back and rate it 5 stars).",
      "It's a small Indian restaurant located within a plaza. There are maybe 8-10 tables, so not a big place but lovely owners. You can tell that there are some very regular customers who often eat there. We ordered the tikka masala, seekh kabob, tandoori paratha, saag paneer and a side of basmati rice. Very flavorful dishes and the paratha bread was warm and crispy.. perfect with the saag paneer.",
      "They have a variety of tasty food options. For great meat dishes to vegetarian dishes yum. People trying the place for the first time. Not knowing what to expect. But happy with the different food dishes. You can customize your food dishes. From mild, spicy (hot) and extra spicy (hot). There is a lunch buffet also. If you are not close by still worth stopping in.",
      "Overall a nice local place to get Indian. We ordered the spicy paneer and chicken dishes. Both had nice flavor, but I wasn't as hit by the spice as I had hoped. The garlic naan also had a great flavor. I only wish they served a lunch buffet on the weekend as well so we can try multiple different dishes!"

      "I like this place. $13.99 per pound of food. You get to choose all your toppings. I recommend going heavy on the meats and light on the carbohydrates. That\u2019ll be the best bang for the buck. They also have frog meat if that\u2019s your lingo. I tried their beef bone broth and I like it a lot. I\u2019d come back again.\n\n**UPDATE**\nJust a heads up. If you can\u2019t eat mild this place won\u2019t be for you. They can\u2019t alter the broth. The only option is the tomato broth which is no spicy.",
      "Not too bad. Easy to order n the place is casual b comfort. Waitress is friendly n prompt to serve.",
      "My wife and I came here for dinner and loved this place! There\u2019s a bar where you pick out all of the veggies and meat that you want (there is quite a wide selection), then you pick a soup base (2 soup options and 1 dry option), and the restaurant cooks it for you. Cost is by weight at $13.99/lb.\n\nLove this concept as you can customize your dish however you want. For example, wife and I like to have a bit more veggies, decent amount of protein, and little to no carbs.\n\nLastly, the restaurant is very clean and the service is great! Will definitely come back!",
      "I have been wanting to try this hotpot place and finally got to go this weekend. I came around 12pm and there wasn't a wait to get your table. The employee first assigns you a table and then you can grab a bowl and start choosing your hotpot ingredients.\n\nThey have lots of options for vegetables, meat, and other hotpot toppings. I would say their noodle options are a bit lacking though. They have beef, lamb, and seafood options. A lot of Asian vegetables and others like mushrooms, baby corn, etc.\n\nAfter choosing, you give it to the employee to weigh and choose your soup. After that, they give you a key tag with your bowl number. You can also order their drinks and other side dishes here. I got the tomato broth since it is the only non-spicy broth and I wasn't sure how mild their mild is. I also ordered the brown sugar rice cake ($6.5).\n\nThen you walk inside and find your table and make your sauce as the sauce station. They have plenty of tables and the seating area is designed nicely and atmosphere is comfortable.\n\nThe food was ready in less than 10 minutes. The broth tasted a lot like tomatoes and wasn't super special. The ingredients I chose were cooked well and did taste alright. I can't tell if the beef slices is good quality but it was quite fatty. And the brown sugar rice cakes were pretty good, not too sweet and fried nicely.\n\nI would consider coming back another time with other family to try another broth and see if that was better. I do like their hotpot system where you pay by weight so you pay for exactly how much you can finish and what it weighs. Their service is also pretty good, employees are friendly with good attitude.",

Dumpling House's table setup was a bit compact, so if you're going to try a variety of dishes here they'll seat you at a 4 top.\n\nThe food was tasty and flavorful enough to not need additional condiments. I found the bok choi to be over sauced but still good. Dumpling skin was thicker than some other places. Enjoyed the spring rolls.\n\nNote: No fountain drinks, all drinks except tea and water were canned."

      "Fun place to eat with friends. I love the variety in a single pot and how big it is! If you are not super hungry, you can share a bowl with another. I ordered the Taiwanese Spicy and the flavor is bold enough, yet not too crazy (well I am Thai so I might have a high heat tolerance). What I appreciate the most though is the variety of ingredients, in my cases, the pork intestine and pork blood. It is quite fulfilling to eat those authentic and difficult-to-cook items like that. In any event, we enjoy this place and would love to come back. Oh if you come here early, you can avoid the crowd.",
      "Great hotpot location in Downtown Arcadia! The food is great, they have deals (last visit free tea) and plenty of parking on the street. However, the wait can be somewhat long but worth it.",
      "I and my friend ordered to go, and I saw there\u2019s a hair in her bowl, which doesn\u2019t belong to any one of us. My friend has really long dark hair, mine is really short. The hair we found was shoulder length and somewhat brown. We called the store and they said they could only make us a new one. Who wants anything more from them after seeing something so disgusting, and they said we can only call customer service for the refund, which we have to wait till (we ordered ob Saturday) Monday when customer services is working.\n\nThis is ridiculous that the store cannot make refund directly to the customer. they were making excuses that the front desk who worked in the earlier shift has logged out of the system, therefore the money has been put into the system and not able to refund\u2026. my first time hearing about it.\n\nDefinitely not coming back.",
      "I love this all in one hot pot place. Their combinations are just right with the right flavors mixed in. Make your own dipping sauce for the contents, and it takes it to another level! My go-to hot pots are the lamb, beef, and milk curry. I also like the house special. There's lots of stinky tofu and pig blood cubes in it! Yum! If you come to during lunch time, it's cheaper and comes with tea, black or green. The prices have gone up a lot due to the crazy inflation, but it's still one of the best deals around these days for a fulfilling, tasty hot pot combo! Come early and avoid the busy times, or you'll wait a long time here!"

      "Come visit this great restaurant and AMAZING food while overlooking the beautiful golf course!!!  Ask for Rosio!!",
      "Who would have known that there's a pretty decent brunch place located amongst the Santa Anita golf courses? I've been coming to the Santa Anita park for years, and never once did I really bother to scope out the golf course, let alone discover the small restaurant located just next to the parking lot before you hit the golf course.\n\nSanta Anita Bar & Grill's exterior is painted identically to the other buildings next to it, so the restaurant itself blends in quite nicely. I used to enter the swimming pool from the building next to the restaurant, which is located to the right of the grill. The dining area of the restaurant seems fairly small, but with so little guests that trickle in and out of here, they really don't need to open the other dining areas. There's also a second floor, but the restaurant takes up just over 1/4 of the entire building. With an open kitchen, several table seats, and booth seating to line the restaurant, the place seems quite accommodating and cozy. I can see golfers coming in after they finish up a game, the wives of golfers sipping on coffee and reading a book as they wait for their husbands, or friends who have the inside knowledge of this restaurant as they enjoy the intimacy that the small caf\u00e9 can bring.\n\nThe menu is fairly simple. I don't think they open for dinner, so they serve breakfast, brunch, and lunch during the hours they are open (not sure if lunch starts at a later time). My mom raved about the experience she had here with her friends, so I came in with high hopes. For the most part I did leave feeling pretty satisfied.\n\nCoffee: For a refillable cup of coffee, it's a mere $2. Not too bad, but the quality is definitely not comparable to Starbucks. However, I've had my share of bad coffee, and this definitely is a few steps above horrible coffee. It's generic diner coffee.\n\n\"Crisp\" Homemade Waffles: $5.75 This was a big letdown. From the name of the dish, I expected the waffles to be crisp. Instead, they tasted like frozen waffles that I could have easily made at home. Not crispy, but soggy! And they were super thin. The waffles weren't bad, but because they didn't taste any different from store bought, frozen waffles, this was a pretty big letdown. Chef's Belgium Waffles are definitely 100% better than this.\n\nEggs Benedict: $8.25 Also another letdown. You can judge the quality of the eggs benedict dish by how the hollandaise sauce tastes, and this sauce was pretty bad. Basically tasted like sour mayonnaise slathered on top of biscuits with bacon and overcooked eggs. It wasn't the worst eggs benedict dish I have tasted - Ugh Caf\u00e9 Nano - but it wasn't the best. The sauce wasn't good, and having it cover everything under it made for a pretty bad bite. It came with a side of hash browns. The hash browns were a bit soggy from the oil, but it didn't taste bad.\n\nBlueberry Pancakes: $5.75 This was probably the best dish that we had. These blueberry pancakes really taste homemade, and seeing the amount of blueberries in the pancakes definitely proves it! The pancake batter itself isn't too sweet, and having the slightly sweet, slightly tangy blueberries gives the pancakes an extra kick. Add on some butter and syrup, and the fluffy pancakes melt in your mouth. There's a stack of 3 (although my mom insists she got 4 the first time she came) and we could barely finish 1. Filling, but doesn't feel too heavy. This dish was worth the $5.75 compared to the limp waffles that I had ordered.\n\nService was mediocre. I mean, I figure they probably don't expect too many customers to come, and if they do - they're probably regulars. If you're lucky to snag a table that gives you a view of the green grassy fields, enjoy it! There are a few tables outside if you want to dine in the fresh air.\n\ntl;dr - Overall, I thought it was a decent place to have breakfast/brunch.",

      "I loved that place\u2026 the food was too close to authenticity, full of flavors.\nThe plates were full , it\u2019s really obvious how generous they are!!!\nOur waiter, Victor was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. He is one of the most lawful employees I have ever met!!!!\nThank you victor for your hospitality, whenever we are near Pasadena we will make sure to pass by!!!",
      "Service is very good and fast. In my opinion, Zoupa Tuscana is a perfect soup with breadsticks because they are not too heavy. Breadsticks are hot and tasty. The Seafood Alfredo is very good here. The calamari is decent. Prices are good which includes soup/salad, breadsticks (unlimited) and pasta. I will come back to try different types of pasta and soup.",
      "One of the few places I don't mind constantly going back to. Love all their soups and their breadsticks dangerously good. \ud83d\ude04 I miss their mint chocolates, haven't seen them lately.",

      "Feels like back in an restaurant in Japan.  Fantastic ramen and rice bowls with meat.  Fried tofu and gyoza are also excellent.  Draft beer is also very enjoyable.\nThere can be a queue, but it moves pretty quickly.\nHighly recommend the restaurant, and make sure you get recommendations from the supportive staff.  You can make combo and order half sizes to maximise your needs.\nAlso recommend to bring kids, as the food is not spicy.",
      "It was my wife's birthday. We chose this restaurant because of their noodle story.\n\nWe ordered their most popular noodle to try. It was excellent taste combination with pork broth, miso, noodle hardness. The cabbage salad side dish is perfect with noodle. Even cabbage texture was fresh and alive. They must have kept it in ice cold water.\n\nThen their poke bowl was super excellent. Rice temperature, hardness was perfect, amount of sauce was perfect, amount of tuna and salmon was generous.\n\nFried rice was just normal.\n\nI was very disappointed with their chicken teriyaki bowl. First of all, chicken wasn't pan fried or pan fried enough. It was very steamy texture. Their teriyaki sauce was very soy sauce taste. It wasn't typical or well known teriyaki taste i am used to. I wouldn't order again.",
      "The pork chashu bowl was a decent size and pretty good. I liked how they added ginger to give it a fresh flavor. The vegetable gyoza didn't leave much of an impression (they were okay, but i probably should have gotten the chicken or pork version). It was a cool, old world Japanese vibe inside, but I didn't care for the Dodger-inspired uniforms. Service was typical of small Ramen places - take your order, smile, serve food promptly, smile some more, and hope you leave quickly as they have limited seating.",
      "Great atmosphere! Everyone that were dining seems to really enjoy their food. First sip of the rich broth hit the yummy meter very high! All the plaques and awards reinforced its claims. The chicken karaage was easily the best I ever had. It was crispy, juicy and tender. They were huge pieces of chicken; cooked to perfection. The service was great and food came out fast. Priced reasonably well. The portions were big enough for big eaters like me lol. Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back and try their other unique dishes. You will see a line outside. Don't get scared It moves pretty fast, even though it is a small restaurant. It's in the middle of Little Tokyo so public parking are everywhere.",
      "My husband was raised in CALI and I never been to CALI, but he always said there is only one spot he will only get ramen and it this place that called DAIKOKUYA. So he took me there after we just landed from the airport and I got a bowl of Ramen and it was the best thing I ever taste\ud83e\udd79.we live\nin Nebraska and there is nothing like that so I\u2019m grateful after all this year of saving up so he could introduce me to this only one ramen place he preferred.(I tag them on instagram and they tag me in they instagram story so that was very cool) hopefully we go back before we leave ."

      "The curry udon was savory and came with the perfect amount of toppings. The Shrimp and scallops tempura could\u2019ve been a little more crispy in my opinion. The braised pork udon broth was perfectly seasoned, the pork could have been cut smaller to make it easier to eat. We also thought it could have been braised a little longer as the fat wasn\u2019t tender enough to eat. We were seated and served quickly, it wasn\u2019t a bad experience and i would definitely come again.",
      "I usually only come here to eat one thing: the uni udon. If you\u2019re coming during normal people hours, you most likely will have to wait in line like a peasant. The food is good and solid, but I did feel the \u201cwow\u201d factor from the first time I\u2019ve had it til\u2019 now has suddenly faded. Maybe if it\u2019s your first time it\u2019s worth a try, but I would be hard pressed to come back here before trying other places. Still a great place to have dinner and the service is great.",
      "One of the best places to have the udon noodles, the broth, noodles and the flavor- absolutely delicious. You will not be disappointed. I tried their spicy tofu udon and the carbonara udon. There is a public parking opposite to the restaurant. Be prepared to wait if you go during the peak hours. Worth the wait. I would recommend this place.",
      "SO good. We were sat pretty quickly, but just be sure that the entire party is there - or they won\u2019t seat you until they are. It is a pretty tight space, but there\u2019s indoor and outdoor seating, and most workers speak both English and Japanese.",
      "The mentai seafood pasta was perfectly creamy, and the noodles were cooked just right. We had 3 pcs takoyaki ( 1 of the takoyaki dont have octopus piece, the filling ), crispy chicken skin was perfect, crunchy and tasty but too much sauce (sour). It would be better if they put the sauce on the side. Everything was great. The only downside is the waiter ( the middle-aged woman with dyed blonde hair and using glasses), we dont even finish our food and dont ask for the bill yet, out of nowhere she put it in our table (at the bar). That was rude. Its not even 20 mins before our food arrived. Please improve the service, other wise you will drive your customer away."

      "There is a master chef and a master mind behind the scenes in this small, unpretentious, well appointed  Izakaya. If the layout seems a little odd the food and presentation more than makes up for it.\nThe offerings are all unusual and tempting and if I were a full time resident in L.A. this would be my go to place for any worthy excuse.\nI loved every bite that I ordered  and my only regret was finding the urchin risotto in the menu when I was already too full and satisfied. It will have to wait for the next time I am in L.A.\nBut if you are a full time resident you have no excuse not to eat in this mini paradise.",
      "This was one of our favorite meals during our trip to LA. The uni risotto, thick cut beef tongue, truffle udon, and wasabi potato salad were the absolute stand-outs. Service was great, we loved their sake selection, and the pacing was on point. Definitely try them out.",
      "Absolutely outstanding. Impeccable service and delicious food in a clean and minimalist setting, what more could you ask for? Make sure you make a reservation in advance, when their reservation window opens (secret tip: use the \u201cscheduled send\u201d feature in gmail to make sure your reservation request is perfectly on-time).\n\nMy personal favorites were the grilled beef tongue, grilled cod, and sesame mousse. The grilled beef tongue was crispy on the outside and perfectly tender but with just the right amount of bite. The grilled cod was super juicy and savory, skin was crispy - I can eat that with every meal. Lastly, the sesame mousse - mousse has no right to be this delicious. Creamy and lightly sweet, it was so good we ordered another one immediately.\n\nNo doubt I\u2019ll be back the next time I\u2019m in LA.",
      "The food is not as good as it used to be and my favorite dish, the beef tongue did come out hot.  A bit disappointed especially when the price went up by quite a bit.  The sukiyaki beef bowl was so chewy.  Just thought the overall food quality used to be better.",
      "The Honda Plaza contains a treasure trove of great eats, and Kinjiro fits in beautifully.\n\nI had the opportunity to try Kinjiro after hearing about the beef tongue nonstop! Everything here was delicious, even the ones that were beyond my comfort zone. I usually don't get potato salad, for example, but this one had a great mix of textures and flavor. We also tried the seared uni, uni risotto, fresh tofu, yuzu chicken, and beef tongue noodle soup.\n\nI know we ordered way too much and we were stuffed, but we still had to order dessert! Their hojicha panna cotta was a perfect way to end off the meal and was the last stop before a fat food coma.\n\nA reservation is required and you don't really need to dress up here. I would avoid casual sandals, graphic tees, and gym clothes, though. The restaurant and staff/owner are super chill. There's a brief wait for your food, but then the dishes start rolling out pretty quickly!\n\nIf I ever get the chance to come back, I look forward to trying different dishes!\n\nParking: Parking is paid, but even then you gotta hunt down a spot. It's every person for themselves here. \ud83d\ude31"

      "The food was very good; fresh and tasty. I had the signature tofu sampler where all three were made in-house. All 3 were very good but I liked the most the black sesame and the creamy one.  The shrimp tempura was very good as well and the black cod was delicious.  I will definitely return next time I am in Little Tokyo.  The quality of the food was superior to some of the restaurants in the village.",
      "We have visited here twice now. They validate parking as well.\n\nWe've ordered the tofu sampler, beef tongue, yellowtail green onion cut roll, albacore and tomato, squid somen, grilled baby scallops, tuna and radish pickle cut roll, beef sukiyaki tofu, ume chazuke, corn tempura, cucumber with mentaiko. We enjoyed every dish we've ordered so far.\n\nWe also ordered asahi and suntory draft to drink. The service is very attentive. We will continue to come back."

      "Worse food experience in little Tokyo. I was looking forward for an authentic breakfast experience but after a 1 1/2 hr wait it was more of a lunch. As the menu states there is a French Japanese fusion, we decided to order the kakuni omurice, Nagoya hitsumabushi.\n\nThe omurice was an over cooked egg omelet over a rice drenched in ketchup. The egg was so dry and a major disappointment.\n\nThe eel bowl was just disappointing because the white rice was wet and not cooked properly. The eel was a bit fishy, and the broth served with it was cold. I\u2019ve had better unagi at its price point.\n\nDuck confit was a very salty flavor and not juicy. The couscous was dried along with stale bread. The veggies were served soggy.\n\nNot only was the food disappointing and lacked quality, but waited long for a water refill or even hot water for the tea.\n\nService and food experience was so poor, I would definitely not recommend. For a true Japanese experience Gardena and Torrance in South Bay has so many hidden gems at a lower cost.\n\nSave yourself time and visit other nearby spots in little Tokyo that offers better food like sushi gen.",
      "In A Nutshell:\n\n-Azay is a cool spot to grab a Japanese breakfast.\n-It's basically a bento box that comes w/ a fresh tofu, tamago (Japanese omelet), miso soup, pickled veggies & you can also add some protein such as Maryland Soft-Shell Blue Crab or Black Cod\n-It's a very different style of breakfast you would normally eat in L.A., but something worth trying out b/c it's really good.\n-Their green tea/matcha creme brulee was really, really good & I highly recommended trying that too.\n\nOverall, this was a nice find & I didn't have to wait at all on a Sunday morning around 11:30 am.",
      "Absolutely incredible.\nI'm so glad we got a reservation for traditional Japanese breakfast!\nThe service was kind, informative, and outstanding. I wish we were closer and could visit more often.\n\nOmg the Matcha Brulee!!!",
      "Hands down the most enjoyable Japanese and French fusion food in town! The bento box shows authenticity and delicacy of Japanese cuisine at its best. The duck confit is pretty good with the couscous. The grapefruit tart, special dessert of the day, was very impressive too! It feels like we don\u2019t get to find this kind of hearty food at this price anywhere else in LA! Reservation is highly recommended!",
      "Came in with my partner and the interior was small and so it felt a bit tight, but the servers knew how to work around the space well! They were also super friendly without being overbearing and the food that we ordered was so good! I got the omurice and my partner got the hayashi dish. I preferred mine over his and their miso soup was paired really well with the omurice :)\n\nI would come back again to try their breakfast and bento meals"

      "This place should have a rating of 5.0, I've had dinner at Chinchikurin about three times now. Despite how busy they are, the staff are attentive, kind, and welcoming.  The team instantly recognized us after our third visit. Mind you, we are not from this country. The food is great, warm, delicious and so so so good after a long day. The atmosphere is perfect. We usually pick the patio, but the indoor seating is just as great. It's my favorite spot, and it will always be a place I visit whenever I fly into LA.  Thank you to the staff working the dinner shift July 5-6. You have been amazing!!! I hope they continue to thrive and succeed. I wish nothing but the best for Chinchikurin. I'm not sure if I'll see the same staff next year, but I wish them the best and hope only good things come their way.\nHands down, it's the best place to eat at, especially if you're in town for AX.\n-Joori, party for 2",
      "I ordered the TanTan Ramen, the noodles were good but the broth was too strong (salty) for my liking. There wasnt much toppings on it either even though it was $17. Good amount of green onion though. The deep fried chicken was such a small portion for $14 and honestly not that good.",
      "When you visit Little Tokyo in LA, the first restaurant you will see is the Chinchikurin. The Hiroshima based restaurant chain brings Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki to Los Angeles. Unlike its Osaka counterpart, this dish is a symphony of layers\u2014crepe-like batter, tender cabbage, fish flour, crispy tempura bits, and yakisoba noodles. Each ingredient is meticulously stacked, creating a harmonious blend of taste and texture.\n\nHiroshima-style okonomiyaki has a fascinating history. In the aftermath of World War II, Hiroshima faced scarcity, yet resilience prevailed. The locals ingeniously transformed U.S. military-supplied flour into a pancake\u2014a humble sustenance that evolved into okonomiyaki. This dish, reminiscent of \u201cissen-yoshoku,\u201d became a symbol of survival and community.\n\nOur visit on a Saturday brought us to savor two variations: the Spicy Goam and the tender octopus noodle. The soft noodle version stole our hearts. The balance of flavors\u2014savory, slightly sweet, and umami\u2014left us craving more.\n\nChinchikurin allows LA residents to savor authentic Japanese cuisine without crossing the Pacific. Efficient service and nearby parking at Japanese Village Plaza make it a delightful spot for food enthusiasts.",
      "Known for hiroshima style okonomiyaki. Arrive around 15 min before it opened and was able to get seated quickly. Besides ordering the special seafood okonomiyaki, we also ordered karaage and several types of takoyaki (there was a variety to try). Everything was well presented and tasted great. This place is always popular with long lines whenever I visited lil tokyo and I can see why. If you really want to try this go early or expect to wait (will be worth it)",
      "First time here with my nephew. I almost ordered ramen but changed my mind last minute because the whole point was to experience okonomiyaki. You come here for that. We have lots of great japanese food in San Diego but none makes Okonomiyaki. I ordered the Loaded Kaisen with the choice of Crispy Noodles. It had Shrimp and Squid on top. It was delicious. We also ordered wasabi takoyaki. I was bit surprised by the Public Parking because the price was 15$ \ud83d\ude2c but overall the trip to little Tokyo was all worth it."

I got a sweet tooth and a thing for small delicious dishes like the monk fish and king crab that are one bite dishes.\n\nAs for the main entree it's as fresh as it gets, price is for a set meal so it's worth it. You'll definitely feel stuffed by the end even if it looks like not much. The scallops and shrimp are my favorite \ud83e\udd24. Also, the creamy scallop on cucumber owner special was a great start to service. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nMy only feedback for the soft opening would be to reword the requirements for sharing a set meal.",
      "The beef was top quality and the service was great as well. Super cozy nice spot. Overall great restaurant. There\u2019s a reason they\u2019ve been open for decades"

      "Big portion, good price, and flavourful. Ordered the spam and egg, salmon miso yuzu onigiris and they were great. A little salty but balanced by the rice. The best thing was actually the matcha horchata, refreshing and amazing.",

      "Love how cozy here! Got two spicy Lobster Shrimp. Just to let you know, they don\u2019t do Combos or anything near that apparently. Worth the 30 minute drive.",
      "Dude this place hits the spot.\n\nOrder a couple of sushi balls and hand rolls that are a hefty portion that can either fill you up or just the right amount to save room for desert after.\n\nGot the beacon avocado and lobster sushi balls.\n\nHad to get an unagi hand roll with that lychee lemonade to wash everything down.\n\nThey have a mini Merch shop with tasty on the go snacks.\n\nThere are also cute plants and bonsais.\n\nLove the wall mural of the wave \ud83c\udf0a and gold textures to make the whole place feel cozy.\n\nThe guys there are super chill and feel like the homie in the kitchen hooking you up right that it makes you feel like a boss.\n\nMuch respect to them holding it down.\n\nThis place is great for that quick lunch or that dinner hangout spot to catch up with friends.\n\nTalking about it makes me crave it even more.",
      "Cute and small spot that specializes in onigiri, but also has a selection of hand rolls, sashimi, and bowls. In our experience the food was pretty tasty, but it's definitely better for a light snack/quick lunch. A must try if you're in Little Tokyo."

      "The pork katsu curry was fantastic! Really crispy, great quality meat, and the curry was a nice thick consistency. The potato croquette was also very tasty and well fried. But the shrimp tempura was very undercooked, with the batter still goey under a first layer of very pale and chewy batter. It was super disappointing, but everything else was so good I'll consider it a fluke. Overall I'd come back to try more from their menu.",

      "The cuisine here is genuinely authentic Japanese, and as someone of Japanese heritage, I am thoroughly impressed with the overall quality. While I haven't explored other dining options in the area, I'm confident in recommending this establishment as a solid choice. One point to note, however, is that the service might not meet everyone's high expectations. Additionally, it's important to be aware that the restroom facilities are not accessible to the public."

      "Well, it was dinner time, since my hotel is in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, I've really been enjoying Asian food.  I've enjoyed Ramen a few times andhaver been disappointed.  Tonight I dined at Rakkan Tamen and really enjoyed their Ramen and Bean Sprouts Salad.  I know I say this most every time, but this was excellent.  The Bean Sprouts salad was spicy, but not overly so.  I ordered their Spicy Garnet Ramen and didn't feel it was Spicy at all.  Maybe the salad overpowered it.  It was still quite good, just not that Spicy.  Stop by, you'll enjoy yourself.  But arrive early, the seating area is small.",
      "Had an excellent dinner here 2 nights in a row, the Spicy Garnet ramen was very tasty! Gyoza was good as well. Long wait time but food was definitely worth it!\n\nFriendly for egg allergy with plant based noodles, though they did accidentally put an egg in my ramen that I quickly caught and they fixed. So would recommend double checking nonetheless",
      "I like Rakkan. The food is great, the service is quick and there is usually a queue because people like eating here. The roll is great, the mushroom bun is so delicious, and the ramen is extremely good. all they need is some non-alcoholic beer and i'd be there more frequently.",
      "Rakkan Ramen in downtown LA is a fantastic dining experience. The broth is rich and flavorful, with a perfect balance of spices. The noodles are cooked to perfection, and the toppings are fresh and abundant. The vegan options are a highlight, offering delicious alternatives without compromising on taste. The ambiance is cozy and the service is prompt and friendly. Highly recommend for any ramen enthusiast!",
      "Is it the best vegan ramen in LA? No. Does the menu have a lot of vegan options? Heck yeah. The waitlist moves fairly quick and it\u2019s a short walk from several parking lots, including my favorite, Aiso Street Parking."

      "This place sometimes eludes me since the last few times I've been down here the shop is closed (currently only opened 4 days a week). However I finally was able to come here when it is opened and there was a huge line! This place is so popular that even after ordering imagawataki I had to wait another 30 min (other snacks on a stick have no wait). Prices have gone up, but taste and quality is the same. My only regret was buying just 4 knowing I had to wait this long.",
      "Hate their hours, only open a few days a week but the food is really good. Especially love the chicken kaarage and shrimp ball. They also had mitarashi dango before but didnt see it when i went, i remember it to be really good."

      "A solid Japanese spot with a great selection and customer service was great. An overall solid Little Tokyo spot.\n\nI had their miso soup, salmon skin salad, soft shell crab appetizer, fried chicken karrage, tempura shrimp, fried tofu, salmon collar & their salmon combo. The soup was ok, the salmon skin salad was excellent along with the soft shell crab.\n\nThe chicken was delicious also and the tempura shrimp was delicious especially with the hot tempura sauce which I also used for the soft shell crab. The tofu wasn\u2019t my style, I like it a lot more fried but the flavor was there. The salmon collar was also great.\n\nI\u2019d definitely come back here again and try their other menu items. A solid spot, but parking and getting there can get difficult unless you walk it.",
      "Hideen little gem in little Tokio with amazing food and staff, shout out to Claudio for making sure our big order was perfectly executed and tasted fresh and made specially just for us. The prices are fair, and the fish is a super fresh tasting pair that is upheld with a clean and comfortable restaurant feel.\nI definitely recommend you guys try them out!",
      "One of my fav sushi spots in Little Tokyo. The sushi is consistently fresh and delicious \ud83d\ude0b and the service is nice.  Really like the nigiri sets, chirashi, and soft shell crab. Usually there isn't a long wait. \u2764\ufe0f",
      "5 years ago this place was the bee\u2019s knee. But having visited here recently the experience was far from expected. Prices have nearly doubled, which is expected, but the quality and taste of the food has declined sharply. I ordered the teriyaki chicken, the most basic staple in Japanese cuisine, and it was thin, tasteless, dry and seemed as if they seasoned it with water. Overall a very regretful experience. I will not be returning.",
      "Came to this place with my out-of-town guest. It's Super Bowl Sunday and there was no wait. That's so nice because it was pretty cold outside. Parking was easy as it's Sunday and we were able to find street parking. I believe one gets two hours validation from the restaurant if you park in the Japanese Village Plaza parking.\n\nWe ordered bento box and udons and everybody was happy with the food. The udon was steaming hot and the sushi in the bento box was fresh. The service was good as well.\n\nDefinitely would love to come back to this place!"

      "Don't forget to reserve if you don't want to wait. Absolutely one of the best yakitori bars in LA. Authentic and delicious. Don't forget their Oyakodon!",
      "This is my favorite place to eat Yakitori in Little Tokyo. I stopped by for dinner on a chilly night and it's so cozy inside. I visited 3 years ago during covid so business was slower than usual and tables were turning fast, however now it's probably hard to get seated.\n\nYou can smell the fragrant juices of the chicken skewers if you're anywhere on the second floor of this shopping complex. I ordered to share, beef, soft and negi chicken thighs, chicken breast, chicken wings, chicken hearts and gizzards and chicken meatballs skewers. The grill master here is Japanese and he definitely knows how to preserve the succulent texture of the juices in the meat skewers while also giving you the smokiness from the charcoal.\n\nIn addition to the yakitori they also have a la carte side items like Oyako Donburi, quite fluffy and seasoned just right and an incredible chicken broth congee that warms your soul. The name of this congee on the menu is Zousui Chicken congee with vegetables. The pricing structure is very fair given the location, our bill came out to be $65 for two people. FYI they have Kirin and Asahi on tap here!\n\nThis little izakaya is definitely worth a visit.",
      "Torigoya is a small yakitori spot that fills up very quickly so get there when it opens or you\u2019ll have to wait. When seated, you have a paper slip to order skewers and then they have a menu with items and prices. Their staff are hustling to serve all the guests and they were timely, despite being so busy.\nUnfortunately they were out of Chicken Nanban when we ordered. All the skewers were very good, no complaints. The chicken thigh is incredibly tender, and the soft thigh is even more! The sauce is flavorful but maybe a little bit too much. They use the same sauce for any of their skewers so I prefer the salted option to let the chicken and charcoal flavor shine. Prices are average for yakitori in LA, but it tastes above average and they don\u2019t skimp out on portion size or ingredient quality.",
      "Long wait since we stopped by to put our name down up front at 7pm and didn\u2019t get seated until 8:50pm. We saw so many great reviews about this place and are huge fan of izakaya, so we decided to walk to all the near by shops and got onigiri at one of the stores to hold us over. What a great call to wait since it was hand down the best skewers restaurant we\u2019ve been to in the US. If you had a chance, get everything with sauce. There wasn\u2019t a huge difference in flavor than dry but they\u2019re definitely more juicy. The meat was lean and just flavorful by itself. We ordered cucumber with special sauce and ot surprisingly a delicious choice to have as a side dish. The miso sauce can also be a dip for the skewers. The sodobodon (ground chicken rice bowl) was a must. All the veggies skewers were delish as well. Cannot recommend this place enough if it wasn\u2019t for the wait, but what good foods weren\u2019t worth waiting for right?",
      "Order the CHICKEN NANBAN to add to your yakitori experience. It's boneless chicken battered and deep fried, topped with an egg-potato salad with a vinegar. This dish is an amazing appetizer with texture and great balanced acid. If you\nlike TAKO WASABI (raw octopus and wasabi), this doesn't disappoint. The wasabi reads more refreshing than intense chili heat. I recommend shishito peppers if you're looking for a spicy gamble. I've ordered the agedashi tofu and kaarage on other occasions. They are good, but the NANBAN and TAKO WASABI are high quality and harder to find.\n\nOn this night, we couldn't go crazy on ordering all the chicken skin skewers because they were low supply. (Only 1 skin skewer per table on this specific night.) If deciding between which chicken hearts, I enjoyed the SP and SPSP more than the regular ones. SP=special? SPSP=special^2? I prefer tomato>zucchini>shiitake. Of the sauces, yuzu is my favorite for its brightness. I think it pairs well with all the skewers. A little bit goes a long way. I tend to order one yuzu sauce to share for a table of 3 people.\n\nI always recommend calling the restaurant to make reservations. For a 6:15pm weekday reservation, I called the same day (@ 5pm) to get a table for 3; I was lucky. On other occasions, I've booked a week in advance for a weekend dinner reservation. I've been here a total of 4 times in 18 months. The best time to call is during dinner service or an hour before the restaurant opens.\n\nIf deciding between counter or table seating, the counter is worth doing at least once.\n\nMy brother likes to write his name down when he visits Torigoya. He comes later in the evening when the 5- or 10-skewer sets are sold out and it's a la carte ordering. The wait is "

      "If you're in LA, particularly in Little Tokyo, Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen is an absolute must-try. This place originally launched its first bowls in LA, and it\u2019s become a local favorite for good reason.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Shin-Sen-Gumi is the customization they offer. You can tailor your ramen exactly to your taste with options for your preferred noodle firmness, broth richness, and additional toppings. Whether you like your noodles firm or soft, your broth light or rich, they've got you covered.",
      "Everything about this place screams comfort and delivers perfectly. I adored the way each person could customize their ramen, and each of the toppings and elements were done to utter perfection. The servers and the overall relaxed atmosphere made for a lovely experience, I came away with a warm feeling.",
      "BLAND RAMEN... it's more of a tourist trap than anything. Definitely wouldn't recommend this, my friends from out of state wanted to come here and I was fairly hesitant. Turns out I was right to be! I got the Yaki Ramen and it had the most top ramen taste ever. It had some meat which was okay but the sauce, noodles, and overall taste could not save this.\n\nService was actually pretty good, the servers were nice which is why I can't totally knock this place down. It's a good place for bigger groups. There's a long wait time so if you're living on the risky side and want to try this place you might be doubly disappointed. The place attracts lots of first-time  con-goers when AX or LACC are around so I would definitely stay away during those times.\n\nNote: There's NO AC which sucks during the summer!",
      "Ramen Ramen Ramen!!! This is now one of my favorite places. Be warned it does get packed from time to time. The atmosphere is lively. It's nice and clean. Staff is great. Very friendly and very attentive. Always there when needed to answer any questions and definitely kept our glasses full. The menu is simple. The food is really good. As you can tell, it's mostly Ramen (noodles). 9/10 And when you finish all your noodles, they ask you if you want a refill of noodles. That surprised us. Parking is rough. Best place to park is in the parking lot just south of the building. Parking voucher will get you 1 hour of free parking. I plan to visit again when I'm in the Little Tokyo area.",
      "Employees are super friendly and awesome! The dandan ramen soup was awesome! You get to customize your own soup! For instance, from thickness to softness of the noodles or the thickness of the soup juice! Service was fast!"

      "Truly one of the best sushi spots in LA. The fish is fresh and the service is great. Although you have to wait a bit, the lunch special is pretty worth. Everything on the a La carte menu is a great choice too.",
      "We came for the famous $23 lunch special and we\u2019re not disappointed! The fish is extremely fresh and the portion of fish, rice, and appetizers was good for lunch. We also got the sushi deluxe combination to split. The sashimi lunch special was the best value item!\n\nCome early to wait! We got in line around 10:20 on a Tuesday morning and got in with the first group to be seated (they open at 11 and the line is pretty long by 10:30. We found out that the a la carte menu is only served at the bar so if you want to to order off the normal menu, make sure you grab a table instead of sitting at the bar.",
      "Genuinely disappointed in this place since the line was so long and people hyped it up. We lined up right at 10:30am and got in the 2nd group. My husband got the premium chirashi and I got the deluxe sushi set with salmon skin salad and mozuku. The salad was alright, looked better than it tasted. The mozuku was really sour and vinegary which i wasnt a fan of.\n\nThe deluxe sushi set was such a let down though, some of rolls were so basic (cucumber rolls?!) And it just didnt taste like what a deluxe set would be. Maybe i ordered the wrong thing but my husbands chirashi was just \"okay\" as well.\n\nThe place is also very old and could use a reno.\n\nAlso to top it off a crazy man was running around naked while we were waiting for the restaurant to be open. Not their fault obviously but an interesting experience to start the morning lol."

      "As a loyal fan of Japanese cuisine, I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. Despite the high online ratings and my high expectations for the sashimi, the quality was quite average and nothing remarkable. Additionally, the restaurant does not allow photography. These photos of the dishes were taken discreetly. I don't understand why photography is prohibited\u2014are they afraid the quality will be exposed?",
      "I felt as if I was back in Japan. Great quality of food and amazing service. You can also ask for a full menu since not everything is there on the list to fill out. Do not hesitate to ask for suggestions. They make food pard by part, not everything at once. Hygiene is good. I was there twice and both times I had to wait, it was worth it. Chefs are very approaching too! I would go there again! Btw, you can also take away if needed.",
      "Wonderful place to get top quality sushi and service. The owners are very inviting and friendly. Every dish was skillfully plated and presented. If you find yourself in the area or even far away stop by and you will not regret it.",
      "My #1 go to sushi place. Hands down.\nUnless I feel like just filling myself with sushi, if I want legit sushi, this is the place. Never disappointed. Chefs are so kind and vibe inside is so amazing\n\nYou might have to wait hr or two, but it is definitely worth the wait\nTheir Mackerel is my favorite too.\n\nThey have small menu but have exactly what I need.\n\nAlways thank you guys, and will support this place 100%\nPlease dont change!!",
      "I love the atmosphere here. It was like sitting in a cozy sushi bar in Tokyo. However the sushi taste is not my favorite. Scallop was too  cold to be served. Sea urchin tasted creamy but the seaweed overwhelmed the flavor. Sweet shrimp was ok. If you like ankimo you have to ask, it is not in the menu but they have it."

      "Authentic Japanese sushi at finest quality. This place serves sushi prepared at high-end style.  Everything will feel perfectly enjoyable.  Hence, they do use a bit of yuzu, but it makes the sushi a bit more unique and stylish.\nThe roles are great, and prepared in the right size for a bite.  It is size also the kids can enjoy easily.\nHence, the price point is not in the lower end. But the quality justifies it.",
      "Came here for dinner in a group of 7 on a Friday night. We had to wait for an hour to get seated since we had a large group with no reservation. Indoor seating only. They have a omakase option but we all opted for a la carte. I had a chirashi bowl which was quite filling and had a lot of fish. I got green tea which came with free refills. Service was friendly and there are gendered restrooms in the back. Metered street parking. Credit cards accepted. It\u2019s a classy spot to eat high quality fish.",
      "This is the Little Tokyo outlet of Sushi Enya. The place is on the same street as the popular ramen place. We orders the 18 piece sashimi set  twice and the chef was thoughtful enough to put different fish slices on the two orders. We also tried their specialty eel roll which is served on a very long dish since eels are long? Quality of the fish are quite high and attention to details are there. There are not many tables so it gets crowded. Usually there is a wait so suggest to arrive early (5PM) or use table reservations. They have a cancellation fee if you make table reservation. There is no parking on site so you have paid street parking or paid parking structure near by.",
      "Very disappointed.  I\u2019d eaten here a few years ago and it was top notch.  Unfortunately, this latest visit was very mediocre.  Edamame was unsalted and bland.  Sushi fell apart and the squid was tough.   The shrimp was pretty good though.",
      "This place was incredible! The service was extremely quick and the quality of the fish was very fresh. Everything was delicious, & everyone was so friendly. Will definitely be back."

      "Love coming here but be ready for a wait. When you arrive, head inside and place your name on the waiting list (I have seen the queue in the high 50s) and then walk around the mall.\n\nOnce it is your turn, you are quickly seated and drink orders taken. A few minutes later, your water is delivered by a robot!!!!\n\nThere are premade sushi rolls that come around on a conveyor. But you can also order ramen, specialty rolls and deserts. These arrive on a second conveyor.\n\nOnce you are done eating, you can check out on the touch pad and pay with your phone or with your waitress.",
      "Feels like japan. Very good sushi and fast service. Plus you get a reward for every 15 plates\ud83d\ude03.",
      "We had an incredible experience at Kura Revolving Sushi Bar in Little Tokyo! This place blends traditional sushi with modern technology for a fun dining experience. Go there asap and register for a table. We had to wait for a little less than 30 minutes but as the evening progressed, waiting times rose. It's first come, first served place. No reservations. But absolutely worth the wait.\n\nThe revolving sushi concept is engaging and efficient. Plates of fresh sushi glide by on a conveyor belt, ready to be grabbed. The touch screen at the table makes it easy to order additional items if needed. (Hack: you can order any sushi on the belt via the touch screen!)\n\nThe variety of sushi and Japanese dishes is impressive. From classic nigiri and sashimi to unique rolls and hot dishes like ramen and tempura, there\u2019s really something for everyone.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and fun, perfect for families and groups of friends. The staff is friendly and attentive, ensuring smooth service even during busy times. The rewards system, where you earn prizes by collecting empty plates, adds a playful touch. You can go for gold with the little toy lottery.\n\nIf you\u2019re in LA, go to Little Tokyo and please don\u2019t miss Kura Revolving Sushi Bar. It's a must-visit for sushi lovers and anyone looking for an interactive meal. Highly recommended!",
      "Looking for a fun, tasty, sparky, lively, and happening Sushi Garden? Look No Further!! 9.5/10 \u2014 my favorites were also other people\u2019s favorites, and the short wait for new bites was exhilarating!! Coming back MOST DEFINITELY!",
      "Not quite bucket list, we'll call it practice for the real thing.  I keep saying I'm going to go to Japan and do a Soranews style review of the 3 major kaitenzushi restaurants, Kura being one of them.  Even on a Monday afternoon it was bustling, but I was able to get a seat quickly (solo life).  It almost fried my brain, so many choices, options I have never seen or heard of.  I had to stop myself from going crazy and tried to limit to nigiri I can't order back home in the crooked letter.  It's been a really long time since I was last at a kaitenzushi restaurant and things have changed.  COVID and cleanliness killed the open bar conveyor style I was used to.  The capsules for the plates were tricky, and I had a hard time getting the plate out even after my lesson from the staff.  I powered through though, cause I still spent almost $50 just on myself.  They also have a waiter robit, which they only kinda use lol.  I would see staff snag the drinks off and deliver them personally and send the robot back to the kitchen.  It was still cool to see, being my first experience in the wild.  Had the engineer in me nerding out a little.  If you don't see what you want you can order from a monitor above your seat and they'll bring it out or it'll arrive on the top belt.  You can also pay using this as well.  It tallies up your plates(they all cost $3.75) when you drop them in the slot.  I did forget I wanted a gotcha capsule, so disappointed in myself.  Glad I don't have these locally, I'd need another job to afford my eating habits.  Hoping next time I visit one it'll actually be in Japan."

      "Walking through the area feels like a mini escape to Japan, right in the heart of LA.\n\nThe variety of shops and restaurants is impressive, catering to a range of tastes and interests. I particularly enjoyed browsing the unique selection of goods at the specialty stores, which offer everything from traditional crafts to modern Japanese pop culture items.\n\nThe dining options are excellent, with a good mix of authentic Japanese cuisine and fusion dishes.\n\nWhile the village can get quite crowded, especially on weekends, the overall experience is worth it. It's a great spot for a casual outing with friends or family, and there's always something new to discover with each visit.\n\nOverall, the Japanese Village is a lovely place to explore and enjoy a taste of Japanese culture in Los Angeles. I look forward to returning and trying more of what it has to offer.",
      "Lots of little Japan stores and restaurants to go to but it's busy here during the weekend. The weekdays is better to visit as there won't be lines to wait to get into the restaurant or the shops and bakeries.  I liked it here during the weekends to get the treats I wanted without the long wait. Lots to see for trinkets and anime stuff. The prices here are a little higher than most places you would get  from other outside stores but good to visit.",
      "Fun place to visit with some Japan vibes.\n\nThey got some interesting shops and restaurants. They got some Japanese merchandises that I would purchase as an anime fan.\n\nThey have a Japanese-American museum if you feel like getting a little history lesson as well.\n\nI would bring my kids here to enjoy the vibes.",
      "You will love it here if you are a fan of Japanese culture. Anime, Blindbox, Gashapon, Ramen, Sanrio, Shabu-Shabu, Sushi, Takoyaki, Taiyaki, etc! Come early so you can see every store and cap the evening with dinner. Parking is connected to the plaza and the max was $18.\n\nThe only downside is no public toilets. For a country who is known for the best toilets, tourists are missing out on that experience. Bathrooms are at the restaurants but only available to the patrons.\n\nI suggest Toto set up a shop there to serve both an experience and sales opportunity.\nI don\u2019t know about you but most ppl who come back from a Japan visit will mention the toilets.\n\nWorth it and would come again.",
      "There are so many awesome shops here.  There are lots of fun trinkets to get, there is good food and lots of other goodies too.  Very enjoyable time and thankful they put everything so close together."

      "For delicious Hawaiian food, this is the place to go to in LA.   Everything is good, especially the Kalbi beef and chicken.  The charsiu is sweet and yummy \ud83d\ude0b.  Highly recommended if you are in the mood for some delicious Hawaiian food!!",
      "We got a loco Moco and their special BBQ ribs, both were really good and the portion are HUGE. It was enough for us to eat the leftovers for dinner too lol. We also ordered a side of spam musubi, the sauce on the spam was sweet and savory, tastes very good with the rice. Would definitely recommend!",
      "Finding Aloha Cafe was a godsend for our wedding. Myy husband and I had dreamed of having Hawaiian mix plate food for our wedding. After some time searching we finally found Aloha Cafe and scheduled a tasting with Jennifer. The variety of dishes she offered were all delicious and exactly what we were looking for. Although AC couldn't offer full service catering, we hired them for our wedding appetizers (spam musubi!) and buffet food. The menu included green salad, mac salad, white rice, kalbi ribs, teriyaki salmon, and teriyaki chicken.\n\nI can't express enough how helpful and involved Jennifer was throughout the process. She was very generous and proactive in helping us source things like banana leaves, bamboo plates, utensils, bulk dry foods, etc. The banana leaves were a huge part of our wedding design (we laid them on the guest tables with the appetizers on top in an ode to Filipino style \"kamayan.\") Jennifer was mindful of our guests with dietary restrictions and created vegan mix plates and musubis for them. One of our guests couldn't have pork so she made a special chicken musubi just for her! She also took the time to ensure that everything was dropped off, set up, and served properly. Our guests enjoyed their meals, which was a different experience from regular wedding food. My only regret is not having eaten more!\n\nAside from catering, the restaurant itself is top notch. Delicious food and amazing service. LA is lucky to have a gem that is Aloha Cafe!",
      "As someone who just moved here and have been craving my home food! Ugh thank you! Loco Moco was so good and I always judge places when I try their musubis and yall are the first place in the mainland to actually make it like us! Mahalo \ud83c\udf3a",
      "The quality is always super consistent and delicious! I have yet to find a place that has Hawaiian food that comes in such a huge portion, that is this high quality and for this price!\nI've seen their kitchen and can confirm that everything, down to the sauces and dressings are made IN HOUSE. They slice and cut the chicken. It's super impressive and not very common anymore\nIt's rare to find any place in LA that isn't over $20 a person anymore, but definitely not a place where they legitimately make everything from scratch.\nI definitely recommend the KB combo plate with fried rice, spam musubi and the loco moco plate.\nThe hours are the only reason I don't come literally all the time, but it's super privately owned and TOTALLY worth the wait.\nSuper psyched to get food for my baby shower from there.\nCatering and pick up catering prices are also super reasonable too!"

      "This restaurant is tucked away from the busy part of Little Tokyo. We walked in at 6:30pm on a Thursday and were seated immediately. We came here for the famous uni pasta and mentai japanese cream pasta. Both were creamy, rich, and filled with umami. The mentai japanese cream one was slightly more fishy than the uni one. Can we talk about the portion sizes? Each plate of pasta was huge! Great value for the price.\n\nAll pastas come with complementary sad and bread. Save some of the bread to soak up all the pasta sauce!",
      "Pasta e Pasta by Allegro offers a delightful atmosphere with excellent service. The waitress was notably helpful. The menu features a good variety, and our choices, the carbonara pasta and Mentai Japanese cream, were flavorful, creamy, and rich. The dishes were of high quality with generous portion sizes. I highly recommend this place.",
      "Rare, Japanese-style pasta. All we ordered were really great. Carbonara was really creamy and rich taste. Mentaiko pasta was my favorite, with nice flavor of seafood.\nI highly recommend for people who miss Japanese taste!",
      "Super unique japanese-italian fusion place in Little Tokyo! Parking was easy as there was a parking lot that was free (maybe on weekends only)! The wait wasnt too bad. Waited no more than 20 minutes for a party of 5. Very surprising considering how small this place is.\n\nThe bacon and mushroom pasta was great! Hoever i do think that the bacon could be a little more crispy to add flavor and texture. You also get a free salad and bread.\n\nOur server Vincent was awesome!"

From the moment we walked in, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, guiding us through the menu and making recommendations since it was our first visit.\n\nThe food exceeded our expectations. The ramen was rich and flavorful, perfectly cooked. The broth had a deep, savory taste that made each bite incredibly satisfying. We also tried a few appetizers, which were equally impressive.\n\nOverall, the dining experience was fantastic, earning a solid 10/10 from us. We can\u2019t wait to return and explore more items on the menu. If you\u2019re in Little Tokyo, we highly recommend stopping by.",
      "I think this place is overrated for it's ramen. I got the \"#1 best seller\" tonkatsu ramen with everything. I was very disappointed. First, my egg was over cooked and wasn't presented like all the eggs seen in other photos. Second, the overall flavor of the ramen wasn't as expected, it was dull and lackluster. Third, the noodles felt cheap given that it costs an extra $2 to upgrade to premium noodles. I've had much better ramen at other places and don't recommend this place. Service wise, there's a form to fill out when placing an order which is convenient but overall service is lacking. I also tried the karage and it was good, but I expected better from this ramen house that supposedly serves authentic, premium ramen.",
      "Extremely disappointed!!!  Gyoza were absolute grease-balls!  Tasted like greasy hamburgers. Gross! Worst gyoza I\u2019ve ever had.  Tonkatsu ramen flavorless. Ugh.  And the waitress ignored our topping selection and simply added everything.  So disappointed!",
      "A coworker recommended this place for the Fried Chicken, but everything here is great!\n\nEasily one of the best Ramen spots in Little Tokyo. We got in at 5:30, wrote down our orders, and were served quickly. I had the Black Devil ramen, very rich, spicy and flavorful. We went premium for toppings and it is the perfect amount. The atmosphere is pretty comfortable but fast paced, however we did not feel rushed. Can't wait to come back here and try more!",
      "I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years. No place is better than Hakata Ikkousha. The ramen with everything toping is a must. You don\u2019t need to think which toping should you get, because you will get EVERYTHING. Dont forget the stamp card!"

The sushi quality is outstanding, my personal favorite is the Toro Bowl with a Melon Calpico. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nBesides the large selection of food to-go and beverages, they have an extensive selection of vegetables, fruits and Japanese necessities. You can get everything you need here, and they validate parking, which is very helpful when parking in the Weller court. Love this place, will be back soon!"

      "Took the A line from work. Subway drops you off on the other side of Honda Plaza. Great ramen really enjoyed the amount of noodles and two kinds of pork; sliced and belly. The broth was excellent and comforting. I added chili sauce and an order of gyoza and a Sapporo. $17 for a bowl of Tokushima Ramen. Very delicious.",
      "Recommended as one of the best ramen in town by TimeOut, I was a bit disappointed. The broth was very good but felt the pork could be better.",
      "Affordable, chill, and super tasty ramen.\nAte here two days of my trip to LA and loved it.",
      "The Tokushima Ramen was outstanding, with pork slices and pork belly intermingled with perfectly cooked noodles. The broth, however, was the best part--I only wish there was more!",
      "Had higher expectations because of the reviews online, but I thought the broth was a little bland. Got the tokushima ramen. Also did not love how the pork was made."

      "This restaurant took me back to when I was in Japan trying my first tsukemen. We both ordered a regular original and the noodles are soft and fresh and the broth is flavourful and thick. We were extremely full when we were done. The staff were really nice and welcoming. We paid around d $37 for everything.",
      "We ordered both a small and a regular tsukemen DX, and they were absolutely delicious. The small portion size was just perfect for me. A complimentary refreshment drink they offer at the end of our meal was a lovely touch! The interior of the place is modern and cozy. Loved everything about this place and will definitely be coming back. Highly recommend!",
      "EXCELLENT SERVICE ! Incredibly accommodating, they were able to serve my party of 22, great communication and food came in a timely manner. The food was fine and so was the seating area, spacious enough for my group to be seated close to each other.",
      "The Tsukemen is $14 for Original. The noodle portion is small for a guy, get the Regular one at least if you are a dude. Extra noodle is $2.50.\nThe dipping soup is lighter in texture than what I am used to, but it is fine. The soup base is on the saltier side but still enjoyable.\nOverall I still think it is a legit taste.\n\nThe servers are pretty attentive. They\u2019ll serve the hot stone midway through your meal to keep your broth nice and hot. I will request for a dashi broth at in the end to finish up the soup base.\n\nBe warned parking in Little Tokyo is a bit of a circus.\n\nAlso a notable art is the little art piece dangling from the ceiling.",
      "We ordered the tsukumen deluxe large and the portion was massive! The noodles were al dente, the broth delicious without being too heavy and the egg was runny and full of flavor. Service was also top notch. Will definitely be back!"

      "I got lucky with the parking out front, but not inside because of their BOGO soft opening deal. It was packed with a small line to order. I had takeout, so forgive the togo containers in the photos.\n\nI got the Street Cart Wrap with beef and lamb, as well as the Berliner Bowl with chicken and quinoa.  I ate nearly a 1/3 of the bowl and 1/2 the wrap.  The flavors were very addictive. This was a comfort food I never knew I needed.  Such freshness and I loved the texture of all the ingredients in the salad. The berliner sauce had a pleasant tang to it.  The Wrap had a garlic aioli that I wish I had more to dunk with. Definitely worth checking out.",
      "A delightful little spot that serves three kinds of sangrias (I tried the peach) but has also a full selection of hard liquor for the grownups. There's seating at the bar and also general inside seating as well. With tons of natural lighting it is as its patrons, quiet and thoughtful. A peaceful little pocket world self-contained, a tick away from the noise, the relentless sounds of hustle & flow, just right outside its closed door. You could write here, alone on your laptop creating it just observing the every day ordinariness of nice people living their best lives, have a real conversation with another person you cared about, maybe even a stranger, someone new (you may one day grow to care very much about), who initially wanted to know only what that wonderful looking salad you were having was...\n\nOr just sit quietly with no need of words simply enjoying good food, the comforting solitude of your own company and the silence, having no external interaction at all. I forget that sometimes; how nice it is to be still, completely indulgent of the serenity found only in silence. You can do that here. If you want.\n\nI had a delicious 'Donner' salad, long island ice tea and the most splendid conversation since like I just said, I forget, I mean A Lot, I confess, how nice it is to be silent ;o)\n\nThis is one of what I hope will be many little gems here in DTLA I get to discover. I will most certainly be back. If you stop in ask for Shona, she's the other very attractive mixologist behind the bar.",
      "Modern take on Mediterranean food. I got a Berliner wrap, and I wish there was more meat. The wrap itself is substantial but it felt small eating it all. I was hoping for it to be bigger because whenever I make a wrap with other Mediterranean joints, my wrap is huge and overflowing with food for a fraction of a price that they sell here at Spitz.\n\nThe cashier was nice and the atmosphere is intimate. A little too dark for my liking though. It almost looks closed from the outside.\n\nThis is a good meet up joint though.",
      "The Berliner was my favorite. Didn\u2019t like the Doner basket as much as the Berliner but it was still filling for the price. The Doner basket has everything in it and I thought it\u2019d be more my speed but was just ok. Gives me lunch vibes or something quick vibes. Bartender was delightful, food came out fast and feels healthy. The beef-lamb meat is flavorful. Didn\u2019t like the falafel. Strong and unique drinks. I\u2019d recommend this place for a quick bite. $15 Flat rate parking garage near by. They should validate parking",
      "First time here. My son and I had lunch. Cooks and waiters were friendly, the place was clean, love that they have self serve water and doggie bag items available++ and the food was delicious!\nHad the Remix bowl with beef and lamb; their lemon dressing sauce was amazing! My son had the Berliner bowl They had three different sangrias available my son had the white sangria and he said it was good.\nNice music, people, and space to eat outside if you like."

      "Went here for fathers day with my kids. My daughter recommend ed this restaurant and she did a great job. The Sushi was super fresh and some of the best I have ever had, and I have had a lot. Highly recommend",
      "Food was pretty good. They serve high quality sashimi if you are willing to pay the premium. Great place to impress, but no longer as lively as it was before when it was still Honda Ya. I was there during lunch, so considering it's an Izakaya maybe it picks up at night.",
      "Best izakaya experience we've had in the states. The yakitori was fantastic, and our waiter suggested sashimi was delicious. Our waiter Shoya was awesome and made sure our group had a great time.  We'll definitely come again in the future",
      "A little pricy, but not much considering its location. Absolutely delicious authentic cuisine tucked away at the top of the Galleria. Love the inside. Wonderful service too",
      "Izakaya Bizan is located inside the Little Tokyo Shopping Center, on the 3rd floor. One piece of advice for fellow diners: If you prefer a regular table, it's best to make a reservation in advance. However, if you arrive on the day without one, consider yourself lucky as you might get a chance to sit at the sushi bar.\n\nThe Japanese yakitori at Izakaya Bizan was simply delicious. The flavors of the skewered and grilled meats were perfectly balanced, making it a delightful culinary experience. Each bite was a burst of umami goodness, and I couldn't help but try several different varieties.\n\nFor our meal, I ordered the monkfish liver as a starter, and it was a delectable choice. Creamy, rich, and delicately flavored. As for the main course, I went with the Chirashi bowl, and it did not disappoint. The fresh assortment of fish and toppings over a bed of perfectly seasoned sushi rice was a delight for both the eyes and the palate. My friend opted for the poke bowl as the main course, and they were equally delighted.\n\nTo complement our meal, we decided to try the Green Tea Plum Wine. It was an intriguing choice with a unique and captivating taste that perfectly complemented the dishes we had ordered."

      "Nothing fancy, home style historic Japanese restaurant. Very small and quant around four to five booths and around 6 seats and counter. Food is good and well prepared but very basic. Given the size and popularity expect a short wait. Service is pleasant and efficient. Lots of locals eat here.  Street parking only.",
      "I just don\u2019t get the magic about this restaurant, we tried 3 times to get in for this mediocre dinner, the first 2 times the waiting is too long and they close at 8pm.\n\nI thought it must be good, but I was so wrong.\nThe green tea and oolong tea and the natto it\u2019s not even house made, they got them from supermarket\u2014this is the first time in a Japanese restaurant I saw somebody take out bottle drinks from fridge and serve to us lmao.\n\nAnd for the salmon and spicy chicken bowl we ordered, it\u2019s nothing special, like I can get them from anyother Japanese restaurant.the only thing I like about this restaurant maybe it\u2019s the atmosphere, like a Japanese old house kitchen.\n\nI have to mention that this area is not a safe area, and I don\u2019t think it worth the wait.",
      "First the atmosphere: it's a cute, well put together little Japanese restaurant. Walls line with art and photos. You can read the history of the place as you eat. Dining tables and a bar to sit and enjoy a meal.\n\nSecond, the food: impeccable food displayed on nice plates. Large chunks of fish in the sushi rolls. Spicy tuna and salmon roll had a smooth texture and world-class taste. I did not use soy sauce or because the fish was amazing by itself. This alone will bring me back. I ordered a combo with beef teriyaki and pork cutlet. The pork cutlet was succulent. Pick it up with chopsticks and marvel at the juiced flow. The crust had standalone flavor that I might use as a topping by itself if that were an option. The beef was cooked to perfection. The yeriyaki sauce had a unique taste to it. Came with soup and salad. Miso is a simple dish that this establishment has perfected. The salad was a standard side salad with ginger dressing. Great way to cleanse the palatte. Tempura was also served, and it was again a world-class dish. Fresh tasting veggies and two healthy shrimp.\n\nLastly, the service:the older woman who was there was a gem, and this review is not about her. This review is about the young, inexperienced waitress. I don't think she has enough experience to be serving folks, so this may not be the best place for her to learn. This establishment is the longest running japanese restaurant in Los Angeles. That comes with a heavy burden. The young waitress was not warm or inviting. These two traits are set in stone within japanese culture. As the older woman tried coaching the younger, she younger woman gave dirty looks and rolled her eyes. She seemed uninterested and worse than that, unwilling to learn from her elder. I will be back at some point and hope to see how her journey is going.\n\nOverall, you will be satisfied here. Please come one and all to a modern marvel of japanese cuisine in the greater Los Angeles area.",
      "Great history and food.  Very impressive tempura and curry, and of course the sashimi was super fresh. I do miss AOI, so the home estylen cooking here was a real rad treat. I loved it, we came pretty early and on a weekday as you must do because it gets filled up so fast!!  So glad we made the effort because it had been on our list so long and it didn't disappoint",
      "Purely for charm and LA history, Otomisan is outstanding. The oldest continuously operating Japanese restaurant in the city, there's certainly a retro feel to this place that can't be replicated.\n\nEver since a few well-received profiles (Vice, PBS, etc), Otomisan has experienced a burst in popularity. On Saturday, we arrived at 11:30am, which is when they opened, and already all three booths were taken. Our party of four sat at the counter, which honestly might have been the reason we had such swift service.\n\nThe owner is SUPER nice and even though she was obviously totally overwhelmed with a long waiting list and a bunch of takeout orders, she handled everything with a smile and didn't rush anyone out.\n\nThe food is exactly like what I had when I ate at my friends' parents' or grandparents' houses who were Japanese American, so this meal was a lovely hit of nostalgia.\n\nHighly recommend the katsu, teriyaki, tempura, edamame, and salmon roll."

      "Rooftop bar and sushi restaurant, can't  eat this dynamic duo combination. Valet parking was easy, had to drive through the alley and $12 fee covered until 3a for those that want to dine and then party after. I had reservations and had to wait 5-10 minutes, however was completely fine since there is a full bar in the reception area. Ambiance was nice, dimly lit so you can enjoy the views of the LA skyline. Had a table outside, which was perfect and already warm due to the various wall mounted heaters throughout. The restaurant has 3+ different kitchens for sushi, warm dishes and grilled foods, providing a versatile Japanese menu. The drinks were also amazing... Tokyo Mule, yes 2 please!!!\nAppetizer and food came extremely quick, only wait time was on the drinks, which wasn't that long and definitely worth the wait.",
      "We made a reservation but it turned out that wasn\u2019t necessary as it\u2019s not busy. But the atmosphere was nice and you could see the city from above. Our waiter was extremely nice. He was attentive and cheerful. The food was really good. My sashimi was very fresh and it\u2019s the first time that I had fresh wasabi.\n\nWe sat outside to enjoy the view. I would recommend sitting outside if you want to take in the city life while having the freshest food.",
      "Wonderful food and our waitress Megan was outstanding!!! Great service and so fun. On the 21st floor of a tall skyscraper and the views were wonderful.",
      "Food was excellent, my friend and I were I. La for 2 days, and we were recommended this place. Drinks were pretty good as well, some of the service was a little slow, but my issue was the front telling us we couldn\u2019t have a seat at a table because they had \u201ca lot of reservations that night\u201d. We sat in their lounge couch area, but not once during the about 1-1.5 hours while we were there were all tables full. We could have easily been sat at a 2 person table.",
      "You are definitely paying for the view and good service. The views are gorgeous, especially if you have a reservation around sunset. Our server was very upbeat and kind.\nTo be honest, I expected the sushi to be better. It was just okay.. definitely not \u201chigh quality\u201d sushi. But taking in the views and drinks are definitely a good way to spend time up here!"

      "This is a gem! I\u2019m a big fan of Omakase sushi and this place did not disappoint. I highly recommend sitting at the bar. Service was impeccable, friendly, and always ready. Attention to detail was superb! I didn\u2019t take any photos because they asked me to silence my phones (you can still take photos), but I wanted to be respectful and also focus on my taste buds and not my phone. Admittedly this place doesn\u2019t look much from the outside (Weller Court could use some updates), but don\u2019t be afraid to step inside. One suggestion for them is to have a sake pairing option as I am a sake lover. I did get their cold sake that ended up tasting wonderful, so I\u2019m not complaining. As for price, I think it\u2019s reasonable for an Omakase place like this. You\u2019re really paying for the experience. Without drinks, I think it\u2019s around $200 for a full course meal and tax/tip. Highly recommend!",
      "Our children sent us off to this dinner date while they were out of town. What a great gift. We had a cold sake with melon notes and their homemade yuzu soda to go with their excellent nigiri omakase. We ordered repeats of the sawara, kawahagi and toro taku and also ordered anago on top of the omakase. We normally don't enjoy the tamagoyaki but their castella style tamagoyaki was so good. This nigiri omakase was the perfect amount but would like to try their signature omakase in the future.",
      "Amazing meal and service. Sushi was phenomenal and every bite was better than the last. The beer selection was very interesting, the first beer on the list being the best. Free refills on ginger. A hidden gem on the third floor of a Little Tokyo mall. Very fun. Very cute. Would omakase again.",
      "Very fresh sushi at good price. Authentic dishes and great service. Chef and sous chef was nice and receptive. Place a little hard to find.",
      "Great omakase experience \ud83d\udc4f Chefs at the sushi counter were both very talented and friendly. I arrived late due to the heavy traffic but the staffs were accommodating and made sure we enjoy the most of the course. Sushi were very fresh, was told many of the fishes I enjoyed arrived fresh today from Japan. Nice and clean restaurant. Located on the 2nd floor of the plaza."

      "Hidden away in the city of Los Angeles is this amazing bar that serves one of the tastiest omakase. Entering the bar, you see a bar top that seats approx 10-12 people, with a open kitchen vibe. My partner and I had a great time. The Sunday crew was very nice and attentive, engaging with the customers and making things fun! The selection of fish was amazing, definitely a different experience compared to other omakase establishments I've been to.\n\nParking was very easy since they provided easy simple instructions on their website :). Will definitely visit again on a Sunday \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
      "Hidden gem for sure. This restaurant has been on my husband's list and he was so excited/hyped to try it out! Discovered it on Instagram and got us reservations for a party of 4.\n\nThe experience was impeccable. Our sushi chefs and bartenders were amazing. Service was exceptional. It was a 17 course Omasake and of course our husbands had to get the Japanese whiskey. Super impressed. Drinks were delicious. 5/5!",
      "Somehow managed to book two seats on a workday night. Overall portion is small. Totally 17(I remember?) courses but both my husband and I are still feeling half full after the entire course. (And this is based on each of us had two cocktails) We went to yakitori afterward and had 5 skewers each of us. That\u2019s how little portion the meal was\u2026\nAppetizer and the noodle dish was really good. Sushi wasn\u2019t very impressive as a lot of the fish cuts are not the best cuts. $170 you can find better sushi somewhere else for better cuts of fish. Personally I don\u2019t like the rice here. I think this place has potential but definitely has more aspect to improve on.",
      "Bar Sawa offers artfully crafted sushi and cocktails served as an Omakase in a modern trendy environment.\n\nTo start off with the most important part the food and drink is definitely top notch. The sushi offerings are distinct. Not entirely traditional but offering some creative twists like smoke infusion without becoming gimmicky. Each course is beautifully crafted and plated. The fish was near perfect the rice was inconsistent and sometimes a little too dry or dense depending on the course.\n\nCocktails focus around Suntory brand offerings and lean heavily into traditional Japanese flavors like Yuzu and Matcha. Overall a fun and creative twist. The cocktail tasting menu allows you to pick 3 drinks the enjoy during your omakase or you can chose from wine and sake options. It would have been a bit better if they offered a cocktail tasting that was tailored to the courses served.\n\nThe restaurant itself definitely focuses on the trendy whiskey bar aesthetic and pulls it off very well. Each Omakase seats only 6 people so it keeps an intimate environment. Some of the logistics around entry are a little lacking. You enter the basement level by elevator and find yourself in a slightly awkward brightly lit waiting room off a long hallway. It feels more like hotel bar at first but thankfully once inside the environment is better.\n\nService was ok. The restaurant is very new and staff is obviously still training. The chef's  pull double duty as chef and waiter as is typical of an Omakase. Here however the waiters also serve as bartenders and oddly the hostess as well which makes things a little convoluted since one of them had to go to greet the next round of guests.\n\nOverall it was a fun experience but doesn't quite live up to the best similarly priced Omakase experiences in LA. However I think there's a ton of potential for it to be one of the best as it is refined further. There is clearly a strong sense of quality and creativity that hasn't been fully realized in such a new restaurant that's still ramping up.\n\nI'd definitely recommend a visit. Reservations are needed in advance and book fast. Parking available in the structure next door.",
      "The staff was very friendly, the drink was good (yuzu sour?) and the food did not disappoint!"

      "We hit up this spot for brunch inside a cool, old church, and honestly, it was awesome! The vibe was just as you'd expect - super chill and unique. Tried the pumpkin pancake, and it was bomb - tasty but not too sweet, with a nice kick from the pumpkin seeds. The beef dish was tender, flavorful, and just right. Definitely going back to check out dinner next time!",
      "This was a fantastic meal.   Food was fresh and delicious.  Loved the menu and selections!   It is expensive but a great experience.  Would go again.\n\nAtmosphere was really nice and enjoyable.  Potions were large for this type of restaurant.   It was slightly loud for those with hearing problems.",
      "I can\u2019t speak for dinner but for brunch this a top tier brunch spot. Everything was good and they\u2019re really trying to push to give you the best food and service possible. They do something different with their mimosas, I\u2019m not exactly sure they explained it to me but after a few I have forgotten just know they\u2019re perfect. Don Flamenco grapefruit drink is also amazing. All the food was truly exceptional. The blueberry pancakes are huge ! The bacon is so smoky and perfect. The frittata and egg sandwich were both great also. I even posted a pic of the ice cubes cause they\u2019re perfect \ud83d\ude02. Also the atmosphere with the service is just so fire.

Our taste buds were first seduced by the crudo, where the buttermilk sauce played a tantalizing role, leaving us craving more with each heavenly bite. The Chawanmushi was a revelation, a delightful surprise that made us wonder why it's not a staple on every menu. And oh, the black bass! It was like a love letter to seafood lovers, each forkful a symphony of tender, melt-in-your-mouth perfection, perfectly complemented by the earthy goodness of Brussels sprouts. Redbird is a sanctuary for food enthusiasts, a place where every dish tells a story.\n\nP. S. I tried Casablanca coctail but didn\u2019t like (I\u2019m also not a coctail person)"

      "Like stepping through a portal from downtown L.A. into a serene plant filled garden, that happens to smell delicious. The atmosphere was charming.  The food was fantastic. The staff was friendly.  The overall experience was wonderful. If we find ourselves in the neighborhood again we will absolutely stop in.",
      "Food is great and the inside is beautiful! I got udon and chicken karage \ud83d\ude0a All the plants are pretty and they also have cafe items such as tea and cookies.",
      "This place is amazing. The only downside is the homeless and drug use all over the surrounding sidewalk areas. Overlooking that, since they can not do anything about that, the service is wonderful, the environment is beautiful, and the food is top knotch at a good price. Try the cookies!!!",
      "I live out-of-state and was looking forward to trying this place out during my visit to DTLA. Exactly what I hoped for, everything was delicious and the environment is so charming and refreshing. Had a teriyaki chicken rice bowl and apple mint lemonade, then took a milk tea boba for the road. Loved it, and I\u2019m looking forward to checking out the Wilshire location the next time I\u2019m in LA :)"

      "This is a popular restaurant on social media, and I came to try it out of curiosity. The portion size of their signature ramen is astonishing, with an overwhelming amount of pork. Even as someone who loves ramen, I couldn't finish it\u2014the portion is just too intimidating. Friendly tip: for those with an average appetite, three people could easily share one bowl.\n\nThe serving speed is fast, and both the tempura and fish skin salad are quite good. The sushi is very delicious.\n\nNow, about the drawbacks of the signature ramen: the noodles seem to be the kind that are bought in bulk, with a very average texture. Additionally, the broth is extremely salty, to the point where it feels like they added salt without any consideration. Moreover, it's clear that the broth contains MSG, which is very disappointing.\n\nOverall, this restaurant offers good value for money, and the prices aren't too high. There are always long lines, so if you're into trying out trending spots, you might want to check it out.",
      "Hello! The Trekking Pawns here! We left so happy and stuffed! Arrived around 6:30 and the place was empty, which was a little concerning, but the place quickly filled over the next hour. We started with crispy fried chicken (very good) and simply salted edamame. The ramen was delicious but not as spicy as advertised. The sashimi was thickly sliced and delicious and came with three different lovely side dip! Also tried the snow crab rolls and it was very delicious. The bathrooms were usable but not the best.",
      "This place was great! Service and atmosphere was wonderful. Very friendly staff and nice seating areas.\nTonkatsu ramen was super delicious and highly recommend if you're ever in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles area. Broth was a little creamy, but still tasty and chashu had very good texture and soft. Noodles also had good firmness and a bit on the thinner side.\n10 out of 10 would go again!",
      "This area is magical and if you are into Studio Ghibli and Anime; it's right up your alley. We gathered here with friends to enjoy great food and it did not disappoint.\nI loved their Thai Iced tea and I ordered their large bento boxes with chicken katsu..It came with tempura, egg rolls, salad, tofu soup and California rolls. I couldn't finish everything..Definitely enough for two people.\nI will come again. You have the entire village to wander around and shop with a full belly. It was fantastic.",
      "Food was pretty good. Visiting from NYC with friends and I was surprised by the serving size of the katsu don. Definitely would get ramen over the katsu next time though, I sampled some of the broth from the group and it\u2019s pretty tasty and hearty. The char siu was also very tasty"

      "This was my first time going to this place with my friend she recommended it and I like the place. It was very cozy. Very nice. We went to right before they were closing, but the food was still fresh. The only thing was that they will not let you share One combo was a lot of food so we had to get the double combo but other than that there was a lot of food left. The place is really nice and great for any occasion.",
      "A revision of a long standing Shabu Shabu restaurant that was closed about a year ago.  It is now called Shabu House and although the sign on the wall says \"Since 1991\" the experience has more differences than similarities. The beef cut with a deli slicer is still present now in the rear of the restaurant in a glass display area. The horseshoe counter has been converted to have seating on both sides, increasing seating but appears to limit staff movement. The food has also been changed with the classic shabu shabu ingredients supplemented with more pan-asian hot pot offerings like fish balls, fish cake and potato and lunch offerings have been changed to include dishes like Korean-style ramen and kimchee fried rice.\n\nThe shabu shabu comes as a set with three tiers of pricing starting at 30 dollars which includes a vegetable and fish cake assortment and beef with the second tier adding shrimp and a possibly larger serving of beef. The 3rd tier is the most expensive and says it includes Wagyu beef. The serving of meat on the first tier was generous and filled a large tray. It was sliced paper thin and had decent marbling.\n\nThe transition of the horseshoe allows for more seating but makes the counter feel more cramped. The dish set up is made up of two trays with metal serving bowls. Shoyu, chili sauce, chili oil and ponzu sauce are included at the table as well as minced garlic and spring onions. Goma (sesame sauce) is provided in a small dish with the meal and was used up quickly. No ladles were provided and the grey foam from the cooking meat quickly built up and coated the food. A Chinese spoon was included and at attempt to remove the foam filled up the serving dishes on the vegetable plate over the course of the meal.\n\nService was attentive though seemed to go through waves of availability. On arriving at the restaurant it was unclear if you sat yourself or if the staff were supposed to seat you. Tablets are at every seating for staff free ordering. A tablet was positioned by the door but it was not working. Attempts to flag down staff after waiting for them to notice someone at the door took some time as they were running around bringing food to various stations.  Once I go a server's attention I was quickly seated and the food came immediately. Staff came to ask if I needed anything about 6 times over the course of the meal though did not appear to anticipate issues like running out of sauce. Checkout was at a counter at the front of the restaurant and after I was noticed standing at the counter a staff member came over quickly and took care of the bill.\n\nOverall it is nice to have a Shabu Shabu Restaurant back in Little Tokyo Village Plaza. The price seems high but this is likely not the restaurant's fault considering the rapid gentrification of Little Tokyo. The service is earnest and friendly though appears to be experiencing some growing pains.",
      "Seems to be under new ownership. There are some improvements and some things the same. All ordering is via tablets now. They converted the inside row to also seat customers. Haven\u2019t eaten at the new place yet. Ate at the old place about 100 times so have high hopes the quality is being maintained. Disregard the old photo posts of out-of-date hours and menu. I just posted current pics from two weeks ago.",
      "The first time I came here, it was 1994\n\nUntil now, it hasn\u2019t changed and it still the same\n\nThe waiting is not as ling as before, maybe I came here on the weekdays\n\nThe income is still there serving the customer\n\nThe menu also is still the same like 30 years ago, except the price has increased $10\n\nThe Quality Beef is AWESOME!\n\nExtremely RECOMMENDED!",
      "*** Tip: bring cash and come very early to sign up on the waiting list as soon as it\u2019s out.\n\nVisited recently and arrived at opening time (5:30pm). To my surprise there was a waiting list 1.5 pages long already. They had a total of 3 sheets available to sign up, half of that amount was already taken before they even opened. I appreciate the guy (who calls you in to sit) letting us know the wait from this point was 1.5-2 hours. Arrived at 5:30pm and seated around 7:30pm and not any earlier. By the time we were seated names were half way down the 3rd sheet of paper.\n\nFood - great just as I remembered it. Regular portion is 10 slices while Large is 15 slices. I love their ponzu sauce - wish I had a bottle for home use. Something to note: You are boiling your food in water. At other shabu shabu places they may have a mild kelp/seaweed type stock. People have a misconception mistaking it for Chinese hot pot where the liquid is super flavorful. This is not that. What makes this delicious are the delicate marbled pieces of beef and your choice of dipping sauces, ponzu and sesame. There are little condiment containers, I put a lot of garlic into my ponzu sauce. Yum!\n\nThey start preparing for the next round of eaters before the current group leaves. As they get closer to seating a group, he will call whoever\u2019s name is written and ask for your entire parties order before hand. Other workers will start slicing the portions of meat arranging them neatly on individual plates, cover it with saran wrap, and place them into the fridge until you are seated. This helps to speed up the process so there is less wait time. As soon as a party leaves, their area is cleaned, a new pot and veggies were placed. He will call groups in and you are hopefully within ears reach or will be passed over. While their rules are strict, it makes sense considering the number of people needing to be served.\n\nParking - think typical downtown, metered parking and paid parking lots. I always park across the street in either the structure or the driveway directly next to it (on the left side) which is another parking area but outdoors.\n\nThe restaurant is very small and not good for large groups or parties with young kids/infants. All the seating is counter style, the only table I saw was a kids table no one was seated at. Great meal on a cool or rainy day! Next time I\u2019d come earlier and would hangout in the area."

      "One of the best hand roll places in LA!\n\nHand roll chef Rachel makes our experience here memorable every time!!!\n\nOoo also get a rock shrimp tempura to start \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24",
      "(also posted on their Yelp page)\nYunomi can be compared to Kazu Nori because they make hand rolls.\n\nFood is good. Service is ok. Parking sucks. Ambiance is great.\n\nYunomi has a small-ish space in side because the seats are along the bar around the kitchen where they make drinks and hand rolls. They have two bathrooms in the back, but the hand washing station is outside the bathrooms. My party of three had to wait about 10-15 minutes even on a week day night.\n\nI personally had five hand rolls and still wasn't completely full. The guy who greeted us when we got seated knew it was our first time there, but he said nothing except the menu is obtained by scanning the QR code on the table. It was good thing I checked out the menu from photos posted online because he came back really quickly to take our orders.\n\nI think the hand roll sets are a cool way to try different fish, but the blue crab and negi toro and unagi are probably the better ones to try. They're more expensive - the negi toro is $11 lol.\n\nThere's free parking in the streets, but it took me 30 minutes to finally find a spot and I still had to walk 7 minutes to the restaurant. At least you can get Salt & Straw for dessert across the street.",
      "I used to willingly drive 30 minutes to eat here, but unfortunately the quality of the food has gone down. It is no longer worth a 30 minute drive. The entire staff changed and so has the vibes.",
      "Delicious handrolls with lots of options for \u201csets\u201d and \u201ca la carte\u201d selection. Each fish option has a customizable \u201cspicy or regular\u201d and seaweed paper or soy paper.\nI love love looooved their Yunomi roll which has perfect texture and lots of flavor.\nThey have an impressive selection of Japanese beer including a matcha ipa and plenty of sake options by the bottle or single serve.\n\nWill definitely come back!"

      "Went there for DineLA and cannot recommend this place enough! To begin with, it has a beautiful calming and clean atmosphere, the waiters are the funniest and kindest you will ever meet, and the udon is incredible! I want to highlight the chawamushi in particular which was amazingly done! Sashimi was great, not the best in LA, but still excellent compared to most places!\nWe had the mochis for dessert, which has the PERFECT texture! They don\u2019t make their mochi, but it\u2019s still worth mentioning. The meal was reasonably priced.\nPrepare to have a memorable and an incredible experience on your trip to Aizen!",
      "Great noods, service, and sake! Three of us came by on Saturday night without needing a reservation. Our waiter was kind and attentive, explaining the menu and offering his services as a sake sommelier.\n\nOne friend ordered the $45 Dine LA dinner course, which came with a set of 3 appetizers, a sashimi set of 3 fish (2 slices each), and a signature udon. It was also supposed to come with a dessert, which they forgot to give us (and we forgot to ask). She chose the tan tan udon, which had a thick, heavy, spicy broth. I didn\u2019t love it, and it took her a long time to work through it. The appetizers and sashimi were all delicious.\n\nMy other friend ordered the $31 uni ankake udon, which came with a semi-gelatinous broth. And I ordered the $12 kitsune udon, which was clean and simple. I prefer their broth to Marugame\u2019s.\n\nI also ordered \u201cThe Legendary Sake Sampler\u201d, $22, of which the KID junmai ginjo was my favorite, and the sake sommelier\u2019s too.\n\nOverall, this is a creative udon spot with attentive service and a trendy venue.",
      "What an experience! When my boyfriend and I walked in the staff immediately greeted us, so 5/5 for friendly and helpful service. The waiters were very attentive and the owner was very passionate about sake and helped us choose one that paired perfectly with our dinner.\nSince it was our first time we decided to try the tasting menu they had. (Note this is a limited time thing)  the udons are amazing to say the least\u2026 I highly recommend you try this place out for yourself! You won\u2019t be disappointed!\n\nThank you to the staff for treating us to a wonderful dinner! \ud83c\udf72\ud83c\udf65",
      "Will go again / price = $15-25 / service = above average / cleanliness = above average\n\nGRAND OPENING = I heard about this place Aizen from a coworker who mentioned a new udon spot that is comparable to Marugame. As I very much enjoyed the sea urchin uni cream udon there, I had to check out Aizen. Perfect timing in that I came during the Dine LA restaurant week so the dinner = $45. This included a 3 set appetizer + 3 set assorted sashimi + choice of udon + dessert. All but the udon is chef's choice. What a great deal!\n\nMy udon of choice was the Pescatore Udon which although is a \"today's special\" seems to be a standard menu item now. In addition, while I waited for my friend, I ordered the Uji Green Tea Plum Wine which was light, sophisticated, and delicious. The 3 appetizers were roast beef with truffle soy, mini chawannuchi, and eggplant in soy. Light but flavor explosion of Japanese goodness...the sashimi set was another delicious set of toro tuna, salmon, and yellow tail. Good size and very fresh in taste as it melts in your mouth like butter. The Pescatore Udon definitely has the Italian vibe it gives off and while it drains down your throat like a delicious liquid like soup, at the same time, it is slightly thick like a tomato cream sauce as it costs all the seafood and udon noodles so you can slurp like no other.\n\nThey recently had a grand opening and based on my experience, this will be a hotspot for something different than a traditional Japanese udon restaurant. The interior is casual but elegant with decor. Secret parking is available but I will not share so it does not become overused. It is a secret after all!\n\nThanks to Aizen for a great experience and Dine LA restaurant week!",
      "Came here while we were waiting on Marugame Monzo, but this is probably going to be our top choice from now on.\n\nExcellent service - the waiter gave us a detailed rundown of the menu (their selection of udons, appetizers, and sakes are amazing). Later in the meal they discovered that we were there for a birthday, and we got some excellent sashimi on the house. Service kind, attentive, and made us feel at home throughout.\n\nFood - the udon is as good as anything I've had in LA (including Marugame!) They have a range of more standard offerings, and the broth is excellent, but the highlight for us was definitely the Uni Cream Udon - rich without being overpowering, and perfectly balanced. The appetizer selection is excellent, and the fish quality is some of the best in LA. Would also return here just for the sushi/sashimi - when we enter the waiter claimed that they had some of the best fish in LA, and they certainly lived up to this bold statement!"

      "If you\u2019ve visited Little Tokyo several times and have tried all the Instagram-worthy restaurants you may start to ask yourself, \u201cwhere can I go to just feel comfortable?\u201d Then you definitely want to try Mitsuru Sushi and Grill. This is a no-frills Japanese diner that serves one of the local favorites- \u201cThe Gacha.\u201d It\u2019s something every local loves. You can\u2019t really call yourself a connoisseur of Little Tokyo food until you\u2019ve had this unique breakfast/brunch item. What is the \u201cGacha\u201d you ask? Basically it\u2019s an omelette filled with your choice of protein (sausage, spam, etc.) and served with either hash browns or rice (the better choice). The salty omelette is perfectly paired with the rice and envelops your tastebuds and hugs your soul with pure goodness!

      "A Symphony of Flavors at Mitsuru Sushi and Grill\n\nAfter an extended hiatus from indulging in the art of sushi, my return to the experience at Mitsuru Sushi and Grill was nothing short of extraordinary. This hidden gem, which I stumbled upon through a friend\u2019s recommendation, proved to be a culinary revelation.\n\nAs a party of three, we embarked on a gastronomic journey, each selecting different dishes to sample the breadth of the menu. The \u2018Special B\u2019 sushi platter at Mitsuru was a masterful display of freshness and finesse, each slice of sashimi whispering tales of the sea with its impeccable texture and taste. The \u2018Rainbow Roll,\u2019 true to its name, was a vibrant mosaic of flavors that melded in harmony, captivating our palates with every bite.\n\nThe Ramen was an authentic rendition of this classic dish, with a broth that was rich and robust, cradling tender slices of pork that melted in our mouths, while the marinated eggs added a level of umami that was simply transcendent. The Gyozas were the perfect accompaniment, their crisp exteriors giving way to succulent fillings that were a testament to the chef\u2019s prowess at Mitsuru.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the food that makes Mitsuru Sushi and Grill special. It\u2019s the feeling of discovery, the joy of sharing exceptional food with good company, and the promise of returning to what now feels like a culinary haven.\n\nIn conclusion, Mitsuru Sushi and Grill is a celebration of Japanese cuisine, a place where each dish is crafted with passion and precision. For anyone seeking an authentic sushi experience, Mitsuru deserves not just a visit, but an encore.",
      "I don't know who wrote good reviews. This restaurant smells bad as soon as you enter the entrance. I didn't express myself because I followed my group. It's a bad smell that I can't get used to. I decided to leave a review on the odor that lowers my appetite. I've been to many old restaurants, but I've never seen such a smelly and dirty place (dust accumulated in the corner of the carpet, an unorganized display).\nEven the server sprayed a strong scent of perfume."

The scallop uni was phenomenal and a great mix, tasted very fresh and balanced.\n\nThe Jessica Alba roll was also very good and one of my favorite rolls without rice. The miso soup was also a great starter. The salmon skin salad was also very great and one of my favorite versions of this salad. Lots of salmon skin pieces and the dressing was just right.\n\nI\u2019d definitely come back here again to try their other menu items.  Parking is limited to street so Uber if you can.",
      "Wonderful. Slight misunderstanding with Saki size but it was handled well and satisfactory. Food was soooo delicious and filling. Hella dark from the tinted windows but inside as you can see it's a great mood and service. Regulars were behind us and spoke highly so we felt even more comfortable",
      "Me and my hubby ordered too many like more than 5 dishes. Everything was surprisingly tasty and has a good balance each of them. Fresh, perfect taste(not too sweet), generous portion, and friendly even though they were busy! Worthy to eat out!"

      "Portion sizes for the bao buns are a bit small, the fried crab one was $9 but wasn\u2019t satisfying and the inside just tasted like mush. The sauce overpowered everything, but didn\u2019t taste bad overall. Everything else was fine.",
      "Feeling under the cold weather, but love to warm my appetite by ordering the Chicken Wanton Ramen. Best choice so far, if you want a fusion ramen with bite size chicken wantons and savory noodles with mixed beansprouts and green onions, be their guest! Also the Chicken Katsu Buns are packed with the immense flavor of crispy chicken glazed in sauce and fresh veggies!",
      "Food is good. Service was respectful nothing stood out about it. I went there for the Katsu Buns and they were out. The place looks a little run down and the bathrooms were the ones that need big help. The walls were disgusting. Everyone said thank you and goodbye when we left.",
      "I ordered Yamadaya Ramen. My first impression when they served me, it didn\u2019t look appetizing and also the ramen they use is very thin and smooth. After eating the ramen, I kind of like the broth. Somehow it\u2019s kind of addictive to me. Unfortunately in my opinion, all ingredients in one bowl are well-balanced. Somehow the sliced pork is too thick. The only thing I can say is, I love the broth. I don\u2019t recommend the Bento set. Far from what I expected",
      "I came here awhile back with my boyfriend and the food was pretty good! I was a little nervous about the food being good because the menu seemed to be a bit outdated, but everything turned out great. The staff was friendly and we didn\u2019t wait too long to get our food. I liked the gyozas the best and the ramen broth was good, definitely not as fatty as other ramens that I\u2019ve had but it was still tasty."

      "I recently dined at this restaurant after being intrigued by its portrayal in a Korean drama, and I was amazed by the welcoming ambiance and surroundings. The chicken dishes, especially the chicken golden original half and wings soy garlic, were incredibly appetizing and offered a distinctive taste. The service was exceptional, with Marsia leading the way and providing superb suggestions. The food arrived promptly, and the staff were friendly and professional. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for an unforgettable dining experience that will leave you craving for more.",
      "BB. Q chicken is a decent place to come in for a quick bite to eat. Price for the amount of food is good and the food tastet good. The food is a little heavy with mayobased sauces and cheese. I got a bowl of chicken, mayo cheese which was enough to still take to go and finish later.\n\nIf you come during happy hour make sure to clearly state and ask the staff what it is you ordered. I got my meal from the happy hour menu when ordering and was charged regular price for my meal which added a couple more buck for the same item. When I told staff they mentioned ohh you didn't stated what you ordered was from the happy hour menu, I payed the difference.",
      "Food is pretty good, no say in that. It is also slightly expensive.\n\nI suggest the owner edit their operating hours, we were on a schedule and went here thinking they open at noon (that's what google says). but they open at 12.30.\n\nIf you plan to go here be prepared to wait for your food, they take some time (I'm not complaining, the food tastes great).",
      "Terrible service here, we only ordered a small chicken and rice, it took 45 minutes to come out. We saw our food passed from the kitchen to the counter for it to be served and it was left ignored and turning cold in front of our eyes while the cashier guy restocked and cleaned instead of serving. By the time we got our food it was no longer hot even though we saw it finished, no one was there to take it from the kitchen and serve it. Had to stand up and ask for the chopsticks, water, to order, etc and were not approached by anyone except the give the menu. customers had to stand up to pay for the bill upfront by approaching the cashier (which isn\u2019t a problem if that\u2019s how the restaurant operates, but they had brought the bill to other tables and then ignored others for an extended period of time). I\u2019ve also been to other bbq chicken branches where the service is great. The lady who is supposed to be the server was on her phone for most of the time we were there, and took a 25 minute phone call while customers were trying to wave her down and get her attention. Wouldn\u2019t eat at this bbq chicken branch for that reason. Would give a 1 star but the food tasted fine so that\u2019s for the kitchen.",
      "If you like fried chicken you need to go here.  Their chicken is so damn crispy and flavorful we even ate it refrigerated and still cold the next day and it was still crispy and flavorful!  This place does it right. Unfortunately not all BB.Q chicken places are the same. Others were a miss compared to this location. I gotta say I absolutely hate LA, but this is one of the few placesi need to visit when in town. Cut out the guesswork, get the original crispy. Then you can try some other flavors.  No need to waste your time on sides just stick to the chicken."

      "A new family tradition is born. One week visit to see the family had dinner here twice. It's rare when the whole family is satisfied at the same time. Just my experience, they gave bigger portions just before closing time. If you are in LA for a visit or residence give them a try. You'll love it. Can't wait until my next trip.\nJust found out the tip was charged with the bill. I guess they got me twice. I will never go back to this place again. Just remember her face counting the cash as we walked out. Totally uncool. Thanks, Lorenzo for dropping the knowledge.",
      "Went here today around 5PM and it was only a little bit of people. We ordered 3 rolls and it came out a total around 70 dollars. (The hot tea also costed money) Prices were pretty absurd and the food wasn\u2019t that good either.",
      "Mediocre Japanese food, no parking validation, and FORCED tips.\n\nAre tips obligatory even if the food was okay-ish? Of course not. Tips are an optional add-on to the dining expenses. But not here. (Look pictures) When you are about to pay, you already have included 20% tip on your purchase. We just wanted to give a 10% tip because the food was mediocre and overpriced... The interesting thing is that you CANNOT change or remove the tip, we asked, and they said because they were 5 of us. It is funny that it says \"tip suggestion: 15%, 20%, etc.\" when you can not even change or remove the tip rate! Now we understand why tipping culture is getting out of our hands...\n\nNow the food... Is \"meh\", you won't be having the \"mmm's\" when eating here. Tired chicken yakisoba, and the taste is ordinary, chewy chicken, not special at all. Ordered California rolls and it was regular sushi with no dressing. Soft drinks are $3.5 each. Water tastes like high school water fountain. Overall, the food is not the main reason you will be here...\n\nThe atmosphere is great! This is the part that it stands out from other restaurants. The reason is that it has a nice entrance, with stairs and banners everywhere. The dining building itself is comfortable, and there is plenty of lighting.\n\nNo parking validation. It would be nice considering since it is $4 per 15min, or $16 max.\n\nOverall, our recommendation is that you should give it a try, but we want to let you know what to expect: okay-ish Japanese food, forced 20% tip, and overpriced food.\n\nWhy overpriced and not expensive?\n\nExpensive: You get a lot of food, that tastes good, but it will cost you... Well worth it!\n\nOverpriced: not a lot of food, food taste is forgettable. Still hurts your wallet. You will probably leave sad or betrayed... Or both.",
      "Amazing sushi here. The fish is really fresh. The rolls are pretty big portions. Everything tastes amazing and goes well. Pretty much the best sushi I've ever had except some of the rolls are pretty spicy. We ordered a little too much and the price came out a little high, But you only need to order like one or two rolls per person honestly. We got literally like seven rolls and everything came out amazing. Not a single miss. The vibe and ambiance is lively and The service is phenomenal. All the waiters are very kind and The food came out really really fast like really really fast. Everything about the this place is Wonderful! Coming back here another time.",

      "Located in the Arts District of DTLA, Manuela was such a vibe. From the ambiance to the excellent service to the delicious food, I really enjoyed it all. My sister felt the food was better in theory than actually execution but she's also a chef who works for a Michelin star chef, so her standards are a wee bit higher than ours, the layman. LOL\n\nI loved how thorough the menu was in listing all the ingredients of each dish! I really appreciate menus like that. Both indoor and outdoor seating were beautiful. Everything was solid.\n\nMy husband loves cornbread, so I ordered one to-go for him. The server told us that they were made-to-order, so she would fire it up a little before we were ready to leave. My husband was so excited when I gave it to him after I got home. WHAT AN UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT! It was the *driest*, most flavorless cornbread we had ever had in our lives. It wasn't sweet at all but maybe that was because they included what tasted like a maple butter on the side.\n\nI told one of my besties and he said that he had had it before and that it was really good. So he felt it was possible that it was some kind of off-day they were having with the cornbread.\n\nThat was the reason for one-star drop for me. Otherwise, everything else was excellent.",
      "This place for me is 10/10. It is such beautiful place, the food is more than delicious I highly recommend to get the full experience about appetizers, mains and desserts. There is not anything wrong at this place. Our server Medina made us feel so special. Soooo if anyone wants such special and gastronomic experience in LA definitely you all should go to Manuela. Can\u2019t wait to go back",
      "This is my second visit. I'm still impressed with the food\u2014I love the oysters. They're fresh, and the topping enhances them beautifully. If you are a mushroom lover, don't miss out on the hen of the wood mushrooms. I love how they combine with the cornbread (which is similar to cornbread). It adds more flavor and sweetness together.\n\nAnd always, shout out to the steak\u2014it's so perfect you can't criticize it.",
      "I had brunch here with a group of 6 over the weekend.\n\nPositives:\n\nOverall, experience was good. Quality of the food was good with decent portion sizes. The ambiance was what you'd expect from a restaurant in the Arts District of LA: converted industrial space to a trendy indoor/outdoor restaurant. Despite the heat, there was great sun cover and we were very comfortable outside. The place looks nice, has cool stuff nearby (art museum and chicken coop/garden), and feels secluded from the rest of downtown LA.\n\nThe food was tasty. Our table ordered a burger, 3 eggs benedicts, beignets, and french toast. The first three were great, and I was surprised to see the benedict served on bread pudding with a slightly spicy ham. The french bread was probably the only thing that pulled the food rating down. This thing was THICC, and except for a bit in the middle, was a little too dry - not what you expect from french toast, in my opinion. It just felt like I was eating a dense loaf of bread with a bit of fruit and whipped cream on top, and really could have used something more to make it more moist.\n\nCould have been better:\n\nService was solid, but the only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the restaurant gratuity fees, which come automatically applied (but can be removed at request).\n\nThis 2% fee is for a living wage or whatever, which I just don't feel like is my responsibility - if you want to provide this, why don't you pay the servers more? I realize there are complexities to pricing and running restaurants I'm not aware of, so this may be a much larger problem.\n\nThere's also an automatic 20% gratuity added for groups of 6 or more. We typically tip this much already, but just having that automatically selected is frustrating because it no longer feels like a choice to tip 20%, but instead is an obligation.",
      "What a gorgeous place to have lunch/brunch. Vibe's chill and food was amazing!\n\nFood/Drinks: Food was delicious. Our server recommended the cream biscuits to start, and her suggestion was on point. Best flaky bread I've ever had! I personally ended up having their venison burger, and it has earned being one of their most popular dish for a reason. It was recommended medium rare and it was super juicy. However, the best dish we had was the shared roasted cauliflower dish. It was seasoned amazingly well and I highly would recommend this as your filler!\n\nService/Ambiance: Top notch. Server was really knowledgeable on immediately started recommending dishes. Throughout our entire meal, other staff members would come by and clear our dishes as we finish them and provided new utensils. Huge plus. And obviously cannot disregard the views/ambiance! Outdoorsy feel and not chilly since they had heaters on.\n\nRating: 10/10\nRecommendations: Roasted cauliflower, cream biscuits!"

      "So far, this is my other favorite besides Sushi Takeda. It came with so many dishes, and every individual one was detailed and well-made. They only have one session per day, and the setting is very authentic Japanese style. This is the omakase place that I\u2019ll keep coming back to.",
      "Top quality seafood, amazing craftsmanship, and abundant varieties! My favorites were the oyster and monkfish liver!",
      "Good, but honestly not worth the hassle of getting a reservation when you will find an equally satisfactory (or better) experience at 715 Sushi, Ginza, or Morihiro. There was nothing that especially wowed me, though my favorite dishes of the night were the ankimo (monkfish liver) and mackerel handroll.\n\nUnlike the other omakase restaurants I mentioned, Sushi Kaneyoshi did not offer dessert nor the option of adding extra courses at the end of this meal. I was quite disappointed with receiving just tamago at the end and would have ordered extra courses.\n\nThe restaurant seats 11 people, which ends up feeling like a less intimate experience than other places that seat far fewer. To be honest, my experience was ruined sitting next to 3 raucous regulars who were friendly with the chef and enjoyed making their conversations and antics known to the entire room.",
      "Deliberately hard to find from the outside, refined Japanese craftsmanship inside, with just enough Los Angeles flair.\n\nFood is superb, and if you can snag a reservation to one of the Kaneyoshi x Inaba collaboration nights, it's even better, if that's believable. The latter are not cheap (paying two chefs, each with their own Michelin star, never is), but it's so good."

      "We chose this restaurant to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary and had the 7 course Plant Based Kaiseki Tasting Menu.  It was so delicious.\nEvery item that came out was so beautifully and artfully presented.  It was really like eating artworks.  Each item is also healthy and simple but the taste is so 'balanced.'  It is hard to describe the deliciousness but my palate knows it.\nAlso, it seems that each item is small in portion(except the hot pot) but at the end of our meals we were both very full and satisfied.\n\nThe main entree is a big portion of Japanese hot pot with all different kinds of mushrooms , 2 different kinds of tofu, and different kinds of Asian vegetables.  A plate of udon was added at the end to the hot pot.  The broth of the hot pot was a delicious sesame miso and soy milk broth.  So yum!\n\nThe service was excellent.  Waitress and manager helped us with the hot pot and cleared dirty dishes quickly.  Even the owner came and helped us.  She was so sweet and when we told her about the tough stem of one of the vegetables that she wanted to correct this problem for future customers and makes sure that it will be corrected.  It shows that this restaurant cares about the quality of their products.\n\nThe ambience was calm and serene although the outside of this restaurant is busy LA downtown streets.   We  don't hear what is going on outside once inside the restaurant but a nice, serene, and calming music.\n\nAt the end of the meals we were treated with a special desserts on the house for our anniversary that includes red bean cakes, mochi cakes, and fresh fruits.  This is on top of the black sesame and cacao plant based ice creams that were included in the meal.\n\nI was so happy that I picked this restaurant for our celebration.  We will be back with our friends.\n\nWe came on a Sunday night and parked at Aiso Parking garage which is located 1/2 a block diagonally from the restaurant.  It turned out the parking was free after 5 pm.  Nice!",
      "If you want true, authentic Japanese food with the best quality and the dedication of skill in the food, then this restaurant is the perfect place to explore for you. This family owned restaurant, they care so much about the food and setvice. They are perfectionist on how to bring the best ans plate it on the dishes. they are constantly evolving. I have been eating lots of Japanese food in my life. This is one of the most authentic Japanese food I ever had. Deliciousness and dining experiences are  beyond my imagination. I highly recommended it",
      "Been here twice it\u2019s located in the heart of little Tokyo on 1st street. The food and service is incredible! The restaurant is gorgeous, simple minimalist Japanese.\n\nBoth times we\u2019ve ordered the Yosenabe Kaiseki course. It\u2019s really delicious and there\u2019s many courses. Everything is presented beautifully. Our meal  started off with 3 appetizers, sashimi, chawanmushi (so silky), soup and the basket full of seafood. It also came with a side of udon & porridge. Followed by dessert and tea. Everything so good! And so much food!\n\nWe\u2019ve also been to their bar on a couple of occasions  & they have an extensive sake list. They even have sparkling sake! My new favorite. They also have a great bar food menu. Highly recommend this gem.\n\nThe owner Tomoko is lovely ",
      "My experience, from three visits total were all positive.  I think the cost performance is good considering how expensive sushi omakase can be lately.  They have three price options for each menu.  I tried all options for sushi omakase.  My favorite pick is the middle one."

It\u2019s a stressful job during lunch hours I\u2019m sure but they were able to serve a large table(6-7 ppl?), a party of 1, and another table of 3\u2014 while me and bestie their sat kinda hungry and uhh kinda trynna not lose our minds as other tables stared at us sitting like the sims for 40 minutes straight yapping and trynna forget that we were starving when we had other places and things we wanted to go see as well \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude14 that day we deliberated tipping for the first time in our lives.\n\nThe server wasn\u2019t unkind\u2026I think she was doing her best.\n\nbut it felt like there was an understaffed problem here\u2014 yet on the other hand I felt like I couldn\u2019t forgive gurlie for making us sit and wait and then remind her that all we ordered was plates of 8 pieces sushi and a bowl of soup. She was doing her best but still\u2014 I saw the ppl constantly making orders over there at the kitchen too\u2026jus dunno what was goin on that day with them man\u2026\n\ud83e\udd28um Sushi & Teri\u2014 please\ud83d\ude2ddo better.

(Actually don\u2019t explain \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcabjust don\u2019t do this to ur customers again yall)\n\nAtmosphere was okay\u2026it\u2019s a small space: but that being said I think the goal would be to let ppl get their meals also they can leave and you can have more customers come in\u2026\n\nAnyways food was okay. I didn\u2019t expect anything exciting or anything for a 15?16? Dollar per sushi plate and like 2-3$ miso soup. It was the Alaska and Baja rolls\u2014 so like fish- rice-seaweed- and avocado and the gist\u2014 you kinda can\u2019t go wrong with that.\nFood is food. And it was edible and tasted as expected \ud83d\udc4d did waiting to eat for an hour ruin the taste? Yes. But did I still tip? Yeah. I did \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dbecause idk MANNERS MATTER besties.",
      "Solid Japanese food restaurant. The portions are a bit smaller than surrounding restaurants but it is cheaper. I like the Ramen here because they bring it to you piping hot which is what I like. Japanese noodle places tend to serve Ramen lukewarm which is not my style.

The service was friendly but not particularly attentive.\nAs for the price level, I was pleasantly\nsurprised. The prices were reasonable and reflected the average dining experience.

      "We came here for lunch on a Monday (Oct 9, 2023) as most of the highly-rated sushi spots are closed on Mondays in Little Tokyo. The dining room was empty except for one other table. This place is located inside a hotel on the second floor. The sushi is definitely fresh but the preparation style wasn\u2019t a fit for us. The salmon sashimi and nigiri (and a few other types of fish) are presented with the chewy skin still on which leaves an undesirable texture. While it does look artsy (and allows the restaurant to serve fish parts that most others would trim away), it wasn\u2019t palette friendly for us. We also tried the wagyu sushi which the server verified for us was Japanese A5 wagyu but it didn\u2019t hit the mark. I\u2019m not sure what was going on as it did not have the baseline umami that A5 has and tasted like American wagyu. Miso soup came with my entree and the soup was brought out after my entree was out for a bit. The staff was kind but seemed like a new crew. $100+ for a subpar LA sushi experience. There are much better places in LA.",
      "Tamon Sushi is an underrated gem, located on the second floor of the Miyako Hotel. Japanese hospitality with Japanese-speaking servers, serving authentic Washoku.\n\nI\u2019ve stayed loyal to Tamon throughout the years, including when they downsized their menu to only sushi, and am glad that they are back in full force now.\n\nDefinitely try their Fatty Fish nigiri set ($20), which features select chu-toro, yellowtail, and salmon at 2 pieces each, or their Senior Bento ($25) which features grilled fish, simmered veggies, mixed tempura, rice and miso soup.\n\nLOVE their happy hour, which features reduced sake, shochu, and beer options to pair with their fabulous food offerings. Happy hour runs from 5:30-7:30pm, and simply rocks. Closed Sundays and Wednesdays.\n\nExcellent views over Historical 1st Street, calm ambiance with plenty of choices to suit any taste. This place consistently earns their 5 stars.",
      "Quiet unassuming restaurant on the second floor of the hotel.  I was the only customer at 6:30 on a Monday evening.  Staff lovely. Chirashi heavenly and $50 well spent.",
      "We found this gem of a restaurant hidden on the second floor of the Miyako hotel. It's one of the best kept secrets in LA! Delicious and authentic Japanese food. Fresh and tasty seafood! Try the Chirashi!",
      "TAMON is such a cozy Japanese restaurant in Downtown, Los Angeles!\nStaffs were very friendly and courteous.\n\nI had the Wonton Shio(Salt) Ramen, with the Garlic Butter Pork Gyoza(dumpling).  Super authentic quality and great price.\nI will definitely go back there to try other Ramen (Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen) next time!\n\nI highly recommend tthis restaurant. : )"

      "We were all satisfied with our food. Waiter was nice to us, my dad was pleased and he's not easily pleased. We didn't know that for 5 people or more they automatically deduct a tip, (we had 6 people ) so when we left cash at the table they stopped is outside and told us we OVER TIPPED witch was really nice of them to be honest with us. Its a small place but at the  VERY BACK there's two tables with setting for 6 people each.",
      "Quality of food was amazing. If you're dining in, it is a bit cramped which is why we did take out.  Atmosphere is generally very welcoming!",
      "My family and I would go here all the time and Gina, the owner was ALWAYS so kind we would have good laughs with her. \ud83e\udd70 Tonight we came in and found out that Gina retired and sold the place to someone who had worked with her before. I think she left her place in good hands. The food was still just as good as I remembered it to be and the service was awesome. The new owner, Andrew was always checking up to make sure everything was okay.\n\nWe ordered the Tofu BBQ (medium spicy) and vegetarian bibimbap. DELICIOUS and flavorful!\n\nWe will miss you here Gina! \u2764\ufe0f",
      "GREAT!!! A bit expensive, however the food is over-the-top, 5 star food!!! No single complaint! The waiters are also very nice and helpful. It's not your average fake Asian restaurant, so I totally reccomend going when having the chance!!!",
      "The sushi was pretty good, as well as the edamame! We sat there for a bit after eating to get some rest and we felt the services looking at us, making us feel as if we needed to leave soon. Other than that, it was good"

      "This little market is adjacent to a mall that has a Daiso store. We had planned on eating at the sushi restaurant on the 3rd floor of the mall, but it was closed that day, so we wandered into the market place. They have everything, and reasonable prices. They also have a fresh sushi bar. The sushi was prepackaged when we arrived, so I was skeptical that it would be any good, but after we made our purchase and found a table outside to eat at, we discovered that the sushi was delicious and the miso soup was the best I've had. I would definitely shop there again and buy sushi for lunch.",
      "Incredible supermarket that has not only Korean/asian products but also imported and local goods. The variety is amazing and was completely unexpected",
      "A nice little Japanese community area with some stores and restaurants. It can get crowded during afternoon time but it\u2019s not a big deal and still can walk around. My favourite place will probably be a Japanese restaurant with sushi on little trains that you can pick it up yourself, very interesting!",
      "So many authentic and interesting stores! Very similar to real Japanese markets. Take ur time to explore and wander! You never know what hidden gems there are if u don\u2019t look down the side paths",
      "Big market with a variety of foods. Their produce section was huge and they have live crabs and lobsters! They had little sample areas all throughout and the people in the beauty area were so sweet and helpful. Honestly, loved their customer service and of you're there, check out their Besitos soda, it was really good."

      "One of the best vegan ramen in Downtown. I had white creamy ramen with very good gluten-free noodles. Also gyozas and avocado-veggie sushi with leafy salad with tasty vegan dressing - everything this was good! Pretty nice vegan menu for a reasonable price! Nice service, thank you!",
      "Great ramen, cool vibes. Of all the ramen spots we visited in Little Tokyo, this was the best. We saw lines out the doors at other places but this is seemingly a hidden gem. The shoyu broth was insanely good. The spicy ramen was bonkers. It verges on the edge of \u201ctoo spicy\u201d but spice-heads will love it. 10/10. Will visit again.",
      "Traveling with my father who has never had ramen or gyoza in his life and I don't think I could have picked a better place in all of the world outside of Japan for him to try. This place is awesome, the service and the atmosphere is top notch and the food was delicious \ud83d\ude0b I was in heaven and the happy hour beer was a great deal. My Dad loved it he said it was so flavorful and said he's never had anything like it. It was awesome to share this experience and I would eat here again any day of the week. I am fat and happy and you should be too!",
      "As I walked in, I was warmly greeted by a friendly Japanese lady quickly set me down. The place feels very authentic. I ended up ordering the Ramen with the duck and gyoza. The green tea from Dan was also delicious. The only thing I would say is that the place needs to be touched up and cleaned up more regularly. As well as the bathroom ghaving a fresh coat of paint. Other than that\u2026I will definitely go there again as the food was great!",

      "I visited this place about a year and a half ago. It was decent. Didn't really get a chance to try the highlighted dishes.\n\nThe place is like half Sushi half American food. The vibe inside the building resembles that as well. Kind of unconventional but I guess they make it work.\n\nI ordered the fried calamari and it was decent but nothing special.\n\nOverall, this place was alright. It has both American food and sushi",
      "The best place on the Plaza.  Their California Rolls and Spicy Tuna Rolls are delicious.  You order from a tablet (new) and your food will come out fast. Also tried the beef Bento box and it was delicious. Exceptional service.",
      "Made the best choice dining at Sushi Gala/ Las Galas! Tonkotsu Ramen was crafted to perfection, its chashu pork slices flamed to a heavenly taste! Their recommendation was spot on with the Volcano, never had a baked roll before, topped with spicy crab, avocado, cucumber, but if you are use to eating spicy foods or not there are more portions to try out.",
      "It was a great place to eat in a pinch in Little Tokyo. They had an array of option to choose from at a reasonable price. The place is not as much of a fancy atmosphere but it's clean. The service was amazing, the server sat us down promptly but we did have to flag their attention to get the check and to-go boxes.\n\nWe ordered fries (not pictured) but they aren't anything amazing and tasted a day old. The hand rolls were sensational and the yellowtail sushi roll was good too. These are amazing to order to beat the LA heat and cool down."

For the taste of the food, the meat was delicious, both sweet and savory at the same time. The sides were also good, like the rice, mashed potatoes, cucumber, and vegetables.\n\nApart from that, the server was nice, and the atmosphere of restaurant of itself was nice and cozy. Also a plus for bringing a chilled glass for my alcohol.",
      "In LA, with this pricing, it\u2019s probably the best food you can have in DT. The tri tips steak is fabulous. And it\u2019s not less than 30? I can taste the sea food are frozen ones. But compared to the money I spent, there is nothing to complain. Highly Recommended if you are Asian who like to have something hot and quality food. Gyoza also very good.",
      "Food was delicious and came quickly and with lots of delicious banchan. I ordered spicy short ribs and was left feeling full and happy. Just a warning that you'll smell like KBBQ since they cook everything right mext to the seating area. Overall very chill place.",
      "Took my girl to this hidden gem. I\u2019ve been to little Tokyo countless times but this restaurant has the BEST kbbq I\u2019ve had and the best beef soup. Highly recommended. The food tasted like I was adopted into a Korean family and my mom just made me my Korean lunch",
      "Decent spot with an OG feel. The lady that served us was a bit crotchety, but the rib + spicy pork combo was pretty solid.\n\nThe 12 oz beers are $5, large size (22 oz) are $10, small / large sake works the same way. Parking is validated up to 2 hours, at the rate of $2 per hour. I wish the service was a little lacking but all good otherwise!"

Still, if you're someone who likes this kind of food, you'll enjoy the selection that they offer here",

      "I normally don't leave reviews for this place I had to. Let's start with the food, absolutely amazing. I normally don't eat red meat but the beef and leek soup was BANGIN. The staff was amazing as well I was nervous going into the Korean restaurant but they made me feel right at home. the cook was so sweet and the to-go bowl she gave me made me feel like I was leaving my grandmother's house. So glad I tried this place. ILL BE BACK SOON !!",

      "Most of the ox tail soup is a bit greasy to me, but the nice part is they give green onions, salt, and pepper for you to adjust the taste by yourself. The main problem is the service, one of the worker with glasses and cap are so rude, and the his attitude is like you own them money. In the beginning, my girlfriend ordered a spicy ox tail soup, due to most of the dishes are sold out or didn\u2019t serve that day, she has less options to choose. After 2 minutes, we found out the soup contains beef intestines, which my girlfriend couldn\u2019t eat, so I ask the server to change it to normal spicy beef soup. The sever replied to me: I already ordered it, and send it to the kitchen which feels like he\u2019s not willing to make changes for me, and want us to eat the food that we don\u2019t like. At the time, I was like it just nearly two minutes after the order, what are being that mad for? After that he\u2019s shouting toward his colleagues (seems fighting) that all the customers in restaurant got influenced. In short, the food are nice and delicious but the workers attitude have to make some adjustments. I feel like I\u2019m having dinner in a jail, and the warrant tells what you supposed to do. Whereas, I have to be fair, this store closed very late like till 3:00 AM, so it\u2019s suitable for night owls."

Even though the meat is not as fall apart tender as Han****, the flavor here at Kobawaoo is wayyyyy better. We also ordered the the Jangban Guksoo, the acorn noodle was perfectly cooked, so aromatic, so good overall.",
      "Kobawoo is the real deal for traditional Korean food. The pork bossam is super tender and flavorful, and the radish kimchi on the side is just perfect. The doenjang jjigae has such a rich, deep flavor \u2013 honestly, it\u2019s better than a lot of places in Korea. The portions are generous, and the atmosphere is welcoming. If you're craving some authentic, casual Korean eats, this is the spot!",
      "Old fashioned Korean food restaurant\nIt\u2019s over 40years-olds! You can have original,old fashioned recipes here :) you can have unlimited small dishes.you can choose two types of the rice (which were white rice or  black rice)",
      "The food was good! I didn\u2019t find their seasoning too spicy nor too salty like at most Korean restaurants. The price was reasonable, too. We got their bossam (steamed pork) with soybean paste stew. While the pork wasn\u2019t oily and was tasty, it lacked something. But, I honestly couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. I would love to return and try their other items on the menu next time. Highly recommend!",
      "Being a solo diner on a business trip has its disadvantages in this place, where the house specialties are for sharing with one other person or more. My loss.\nBut gripped with FOMO I did order their special seafood pancake which could have fed 4 people, but even though I ate 3/4 of it, with the aid of a soy sauce dip that came with the Banchan, by itself it did not set off fireworks.\nThe highlight was the Makkeoli, my favorite fermented rice drink, ordered the small version which sadly I could not finish.\nService was good but as usual solo diners everywhere are ignored after the food is served. But whenever I needed anything they came thru.\nThe place is busy on a weekday which is to their credit.\nGroups of friends all around did seem to have a great time."

From the moment we made reservations for our family of five, the awesome employees at Pigya ensured our visit was seamless and special.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly staff. The atmosphere was inviting, making us feel right at home.\n\nOur server was the epitome of attentiveness, ensuring our every need was met with a smile. Their knowledge of the menu was impressive, guiding us through the selections with expert advice. This level of service was not only refreshing but significantly enhanced our dining experience.\n\nWe ordered pork gyu which was enough for our family. The banchans were delicious. Our server cooked the meats. Cooked to absolute perfection, every bite was a culinary revelation. The flavors were bold, yet perfectly balanced, showcasing a level of culinary craftsmanship that is hard to find.\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious, leaving us thoroughly impressed and eager to return. Pigya in Los Angeles has not only mastered the art of cooking but also the ability to create a dining experience that feels both personal and extraordinary. This is a place where food and service come together in perfect harmony, making it a must-visit destination for anyone looking to indulge in some of the best cuisine LA has to offer.",

The servers cook meat for you and they know how to cook. The atmosphere was loud but all Korean restaurants I went to in LA were loud.",
      "Our new favorite KBBQ place! We recently dined Pigya, a kbbq spot we discovered through an Instagram post featuring Jungkook from BTS, and it exceeded all my expectations. We ordered pork belly, pork cheek, and the boneless beef short rib (\uaf43\uc0b4), which was tender, flavorful, and delicious. The atmosphere was lively, perfect for both casual dining. Our server Jaehyuk was very attentive and friendly preparing the meat right at our table.\n\nIf you visit Pigya, I highly recommend trying the boneless beef short rib. We will be back!",

The barbecued pork dish was incredibly tender and delicious, and we were particularly impressed with the excellent service provided by our waitress. Overall, we had a delightful dining experience there."

Plus, you get unlimited soybean soup, all for just $24. Amazing deal! The service was top-notch too. Highly recommend!",
      "We had a group of 7 come here on a Tuesday night and were able to get seated immediately. The ambiance is pretty typical for a KBBQ place. They are known for their tomahawk here, but we opted for a group dining option. The meats were seasoned well and the banchan were pretty simple. You have the option of having it pre-cooked and just brought to your table or have it cooked in front of you. Overall, a pretty decent deal for what you get. Service could have been a little bit more attentive since at times we felt a little forgotten even though it wasn't too busy, but a pretty decent place for KBBQ.",

But on a technical matter, the staff seemed to have trouble transferring things off the wax paper onto the grill. Some pieces occasionally fell off onto the table.\nBut otherwise, food was really good.",

It came out piping out and delicious :) also got lots of refills on the side dishes. Posted photo is the smallest size of the tomahawk state, OH BOY it took a while for it to come out but dang it was delicious since it comes to around medium-rare (medium if u leave it on the iron plate). Highly recommend if you go with a group :3!"

      "The food was great, the atmosphere was amazing.\nThe service was also great. Will definitely go there again.\n\nThe food prices and portions were the best. Not expensive at all while having a really good quality dishes.\n\nLove this place",
      "Second time here and I\u2019m already looking forward to my next visit.\nAmazing food sorted by price, there\u2019s something for everyone. Great service as well, would highly recommend.",
      "My husband and I came here on our first night visiting LA and waited outside for more than an hour\u2026but it was totally worth it. One of the perfect portraits of an ideal K town restaurant experience - this area is sprawling so it can take a while to mine the gems, but once you do the places that come out on top are keepers. First thing\u2019s first the ambiance is unforgettable. Rowdy but not overwhelming, enough space to comfortably fit people but you\u2019re at a good distance to bump shoulders if you want. While I\u2019ve lived in NYC and been to several fun pochas/izakayas, this one felt like it was on a bigger scale yet dare I say homier level of authenticity.\n\nSkewers were what I wish all izakaya skewers would taste like. Stir fried spicy squid were familiarly saucy and satisfying, especially for late night. Steamed pork belly was filling and well balanced with the wraps. Yogurt soju came in a fun kettle-like vessel. Just LOVE the vibes.",
      "This is such a fun place to drink and eat small bites with friends. Recommend a group of a least 4 for the full experience and making a reservation ahead of time or expect to wait a long time. Feels super authentic and like something you\u2019d find in Seoul.\n\nI think they have larger dishes but mostly it\u2019s grilled skewers or other proteins. The short rib and intestines (yes intestines) were my fave. Order as you see fit along with rounds of soju and beer. All in all a great time.",
      "The only good thing about this place is the decor.\n1. You absolutely need to buy an overpriced alcoholic drink to order any of their grilled items.\n2. The food is bland/ tasteless - some items not even cooked through.\n3. The service is very minimal.\n4. They give you a handwritten receipt in Korean so you have no idea of the receipt details.\n\nOverall, did not like it. Giving 2 stars cuz the decor was cool."

      "This was my first time trying food prepared this way, and it's very different from other Korean restaurants. On my initial visit, I found the staff friendly and the ambiance pleasant. The food was enjoyable, especially the combination of veggies with barley rice and sesame oil. The pancake and chicken perilla seed porridge  stood out as highlights. The set menu offers a substantial amount of food. Overall, it was a positive experience, and I would recommend this place.",
      "This is heaven for vegetarians/pescatarians. We got the set menu - 25 different dishes that all told and everything tasted so good. Not heavily spiced or salted, very clean eating. The roe, snail, and crab cakes were delicious!!! Incredibly sweet crew and explained what everything is. Fun atmosphere, have their own huge parking lot for the plaza which is so rare in ktown! A great birthday meal.",
      "Of all the countless times I've visited Ktown this was my first time at Borit Gogae and was an absolutely wonderful experience. The restaurant offers an extensive banchan spread with barley rice, perfect for crafting your own bibimbap. Lots of plant based side dishes.\n\nThe set menu includes an appetizer of pumpkin porridge and nurungji, accompanied by tea and a delightful dessert. While the dukk galbi we tried was just okay, the overall set menu was impressive and something I would definitely return for. Note: you're required to order a minimum of two orders of the set menu.\n\nEvery dish tasted homemade and authentically Korean, a detail that I know my parents would particularly appreciate. We visited on a Monday afternoon for a late lunch and found plenty of free parking behind the restaurant.\n\nOverall, Borit Gogae provides a cozy and authentic dining experience that I highly recommend.",
      "Overall the meal was good but nothing special. As a korean it was kinda similar to the random assortment of stuff chucked into a bibimbap at a church lunch iykyk LOL\nTh best part was probably the perilla chicken porridge. The marinted pork ribs are a NO for me they are not marinated long enough so only the exterior is coated in sauce and th inside is dry and flavorless.\nAlso the table got way full and \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574. Probably will not come again but glad i tried it at least once. Like. Its not bad. Its just nothing special. I appreciated the dessert though. Didnt appreciate the tone of the waitress with a lot of makeup, really pedantically switching to english to then explain the dishes very slowly even though im fluent in korean, and was in fact there with my parents and sister lol.",
      "First time here and I loved it! The staff was so kind and patient and explained their course menu. They took the time to nicely explain each of the dishes and how to eat them. Delicious and healthy, country-style Korean food. You can ask for more barley rice (we didn't but we observed several tables doing so).  Free parking in the parking lot on the back side of the restaurant."

      "Next to Korea, Los Angeles has the largest population of Korean so we are lucky to have the best chef ! If you are tired of Korean bbq but wants to eat other cuisine thane I would suggest you come here ! We came here 3 years ago when it was first opened from a suggestion from my son and fell in love with this place since!! We love the Korean seafood pancake.. the crust is perfectly brown on the outside while inside is filled with leak, green onion and seafood.. absolutely delicious! The snail salad is outstanding! Yes! Snail.. don\u2019t judge me until you try! The short rib soup is loaded with vegetable!!! Yummy!!",
      "(also posted on their Yelp page)\nI had such a great experience here!! I was next door at TPO Coffee and wandered over here for lunch. The food was great, and the service was excellent. Parking was $3 in their lot.\n\nOf course we had to get the soy marinated raw crab, which was my first time eating it. The lady explained that they were out of the Korea-caught crab, but the America-caught ones were better anyway. For $40, it came with five crabs. The lady gave us gloves and explained how to eat the crab mixed with the rice and toppings. It was absolutely delicious. It was even better with soju!\n\nThe galbijim with cheese $61 was good, and we also got a pork belly kimchi pancake $22. This was too much food for three people, so we packed leftovers home. I would have liked to try the baby octopus stir fried too. The star of the show was the crab though.",
      "One of the best Korean places I\u2019ve been to. I loved their Pork Belly and Baby octopus dish. It had tons of bean sprouts which seemed a bit odd at first, but completed the dish. Everything was perfectly seasoned. A little sweet and salty but not too much of each. Very big portions and great side dishes.",
      "Love love the food here. It\u2019s soooo good I went there twice in a week \u2014 once as soon as I got into LA and then 3 days later with a friend. Had the grilled mackerel, grilled squid and spicy chicken with potato stew and they were all super good. Portions are amazing. Service is friendly although you might have to get the attention from staff for things like more water if you run out. Love the hot barley tea they serve complimentary. Would be awesome to perhaps have a pot on the table for self refills. I\u2019ll be back to try other things on the menu! \ud83d\ude0b",
      "Nested in the heart of K-Town, this Korean restaurant serves traditional dishes with a slight modern rendition without straying too far from its root.\n\nThe banchan (side dishes) was absolutely delicious; their fish cake is one of the best I've ever had. We ordered two of their most popular items: Braised Wagyu Beef Back Ribs and Pork Belly Kimchi Pancake. The flavor was really good, but it didn't hit the wow factor for me. Warning: everything is really salty, even for someone like me that has a heavier taste. Prepare to chug water and wash down the sodium!\n\nPortions are bigger portions and meant to be shared. Perfect for a large group gathering. The interior looks newly renovated and provides a clean ambiance. It does get quite loud with music blaring (typical though haha). The service was friendly and better than other K-Town spots. However, they seemed to be understaffed and can take awhile to get to you. Reasonably priced, $45-60 per person without drinks."

Food comes in big portions so be aware when u order; though, u can take them home if u don't finish them. Smoking is allowed in the patio. Service was good, no complaints. Super busy on weekends. Street parking.",
      "Everything was pretty good though a bit pricey overall. My personal favorite was the spicy chicken cheese which had just the right amount of spice. The seafood kimchi pancake was good, surprisingly spicy though it wasn't mentioned in the menu. The beef bulgogi was also good, but pretty much on par with most other places.\n\nDefinitely a place to go hang out with friends, less so by yourself."

I love that it's flavored well and yet not salty at all.  Side dishes were balanced, not too spicy but enough heat.

No lines at 6:00pm so that was a huge plus. We ordered the medium kalbi-jim for $89\u2026.after eating and seeing how much meat they put into their dishes I think the $89 is a great value.

      "I took my parents here to celebrate Father's day. We were lucky enough to beat the lunch rush and were seated right away.\n\nService at our table was not by just one designated server, but by all service staff. They were super kind and coordinated, so we felt very well taken care of.\n\nWe ordered the premium marinated crab  & the premium live uni. Pictures do not do them justice.  Presentation was superb, ingredients were fresh and sweet, and we could not stop talking about how delicious it all was.\n\nPrice may seem a steep when just looking at numbers, but it was actually worth every penny.\n\nParking is a bit troublesome, but it's LA. let's be realistic.\n\nIt is a kid-friendly restaurant, and has wheelchair accessibility. It also has outdoor seating underneath a large canopy/tent.\n\nI can't wait to go back with more family and friends.",
      "I finally made it to Master Ha\u2019s after hearing so many rave reviews and being pestered by friends to try it out. I decided to dive into the deep end and ordered a marinated raw shrimp along with a Wagyu BBQ beef bowl. Spoiler alert: my taste buds have never been happier!\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about that Wagyu beef. It was like a flavor bomb exploded in my mouth. The meat was so tender it practically melted, leaving me wondering if I had accidentally ordered a bowl of delicious butter. Honestly, I loved the rice bowl so much that the marinated raw crab & shrimp, which was good, took a backseat.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to lie, the food here is a bit pricey. But considering the quality, it\u2019s worth it. Think of it as an investment in your taste buds\u2019 happiness. The service was also top-notch; the staff made sure I was well taken care of, almost like they were auditioning for a hospitality award.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place that serves incredible food and offers service with a smile, Master Ha\u2019s is the place to be. I can\u2019t wait to go back and see what other culinary delights they have in store. Who knows, maybe next time I\u2019ll try something even more adventurous! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",
      "This place is amazing. We had the large marinated crab and the regular uni rice bowl. The large marinated crab came with 3 crabs and the regular uni rice bowl usually come with 3 uni but they gave us 4 because they said the size of the uni was a bit smaller than usual. Both of them tasted so good and they looked so fancy. The marinated crab came with crab miso soup and rice. The sauce of the marinated crab was perfect, I loved mixing the orange fat/ roe sticked on the shell with rice and the sauce.\nThe server was super helpful explaining the differences between the options and letting us know different ways to eat with the marinated crab and uni.",
      "I have been eager to experience Master Ha for some time, and it lived up to my expectations. The soy crab and uni were exceptionally well-prepared and presented. We also ordered the short rib and oxtail soup, both of which were delectable. The service was impeccable. The sole drawback was the absence of alcohol; soju would have complemented the raw seafood perfectly.",
      "Finally found a good soy sauce marinated crab place in LA! Even though the size of the crab was smaller than expected, the taste was satisfying. Not too salty, not too blend!\n\nSalmon marinated in soy sauce and pollack roe hand roll were great as well. Tiny, but good.\n\nFYI,\n\n1. I went to this restaurant on a Wednesday but it still had a waiting list. Try to go as early as possible (before dinner time).\n\n2. No alcohol available.\n\n3. The parking lot is usually full, so I recommend to find a street parking."

There were not a lot of people when we came so it's nice to not have to wait too long for service but I can imagine it might get overwhelming because there's only one wait staff.

I think one of the others was tofu and another was zucchini. There was also a small pile of noodles of such.\n\nOverall, this was a great experience trying and I would eat here again.",

I didn\u2019t know where to put my feet because it was just all over the floor was I was sitting. Will come back next time to try other dishes in the menu. We came in late but they were still trying to accommodate us with a big smile which was a plus. Thank you!",
      "The restaurant has very little interior charm or decoration, however the food makes up for this. Meats are very fresh and quality cuts. Ask sides are well done, nicely presented and well spiced. They do the grilling at your table so you don't have to. It's Korea town and parking is very difficult, arrive early to find a spot. Seating indoors and outside. The staff are friendly and helpful. One of the better places for real, non-scene Korean BBQ in LA."

      "Simple Nourishing Bone Broth, Beef Brisket and Tripe; served with Steamed Rice and Kimchi. Season with Salt and thin sliced Scallions. Warm staff, affordable yummy place to eat. Simple and Good."

      "Good selection of Korean side dishes! Came here on Thursday around 2 pm and there was no wait. You get 4 dips to choose from which is nice. Their specialty is the marinaded squid and they only use USDA choice meats. Service is really great when we visited and the staff helped us flip the meats and clean the pan after each round. I found the squid to not be as chewy as I expect but the beef and pork was excellent.The meat was super tender! The pork shoulder is my favourite! It\u2019s a good balance between fat and meat and paired with the pickled radish is perfect!!",
      "Great experience. We came late and there was a bit of a wait, but the line moved fast. We mostly had the brisket, but the steak was great too. Our servers were very helpful and attentive. Parking was a little tricky but the valet is worth it! Perfect place for late night KBBQ \ud83d\ude00",
      "Absolutely loved my experience at this Korean AYCE BBQ spot! The price is good for the wide selection they offer. The service is good and they take orders pretty promptly. My favorites are the beef brisket and short rib - flavorful and tender, definite must-tries! And to top it off, the Kimchi fried rice at the end was the perfect way to conclude the feast. Highly recommend!",
      "Let me start this review by saying that I LOVE FOOD. BUT.... 2+ hrs. of wait time to try AYCE Korean bbq is definitely not worth it. It was very frustrating. The inaccurate wait time estimates significantly extended our wait, which could have been avoided with better communication. This review factors in the wait time, along with the quality of the food and the service.\n\nHae Jang Chon definitely lives up to the hype when it comes to the food itself. They offer an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ experience for both lunch and dinner, with a wide variety of meats to choose from - beef, pork, chicken, and even some seafood options.\n\nThe side dishes were plentiful too, going beyond the standard banchan with items like corn cheese, kimchi pancake, and steamed egg. Everything we tried, from the meat options (including the beef brisket, short ribs, bulgogi, and pork belly) to the kimchi pancake and corn cheese, was delicious. They even have four different sauces to complement the flavors.\n\nThe staff was fantastic - super attentive and efficient. They cooked the meat for us right at our table, kept our waters refilled, and made sure everything ran smoothly.\n\nHere's the thing, though - the wait was BRUTAL. We got there at 8 pm on a Friday night (party of three), and didn't get seated until close to 10:30 pm. In this day and age, it felt archaic that they didn't take reservations or even phone numbers for the waitlist. You just had to be there physically. To make it worse, they kept giving us inaccurate wait time estimates that kept getting pushed back further. It was frustrating, especially considering the place was packed all night with long lines.\n\nSo, the food? It's definitely a 4-star experience. The wait? Not so much. Would I go back? Maybe, but only if I knew I could get seated quickly or they implemented a more user-friendly waitlist system.",
      "I have been here since I was in school (10 yr before) and Hae Jang Chon is always my No.1 choice for AYCE Korean bbq. The quality of the meat are always excellent. Price is pretty reasonable compare to the inflation. I always order marinated short rib, prime steak and beef tone. Don't forget cheese corn and fried rice. Highly recommend if you are craving for Korean bbq."

      "Heard about this place because BTS named it one of their favorite restaurants in LA. It truly did not disappoint! The food was delicious and the staff was very attentive. I don't think I've ever had such a thick cut of \uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4 (the pork belly) before! Absolutely delicious. The steamed egg dish was fantastic as well. Honestly, there wasn't anything I didn't like! It was also a lot of fun to go through their wall of signatures and see tons of artists I follow and admire. \ud83d\ude0a All in all, great experience! Will definitely be going back whenever I may end up in LA again!",
      "This is a popular spot for Asian/K-pop celebs (a la the photos of autographs adorning their walls). Entrance is in the corner- visible from the street but you have to round a corner in the parking lot to enter the restaurant (refer to photo). Got there around 8:30 pm on a Sunday night after KCON and we literally beat the rush in. Waited no more than 5 minutes and were seated right away. There is a QR code available outside and you can scan and study the menu. So we ordered right away as soon as we sat down. Douglas was our waiter and he was superb! Even when it got busy he made sure to check with us so we got the extra side dishes we wanted and refills on water.\n\nWe ordered the Aghassi Combo for 2. It was just the hubby and I and while I wanted to order the gopchang too, we were just too full with the combo. You really need to come with more people to eat more variety. I have had the gopchang before here and it is also good! Between the pork belly and pork jowl we went with the jowl and it did not disappoint! All the meat was of high quality, cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection! We also picked the soybean (daengjang) soup. Had a few clams in there and the rice cakes were the perfect consistency. I liked the saltiness of the soup. Warning the peppers in the soup are super spicy, but not noticeable with just the soup. We also ordered the steamed egg.\n\nSide dishes were so good. The potatoes and the white (baek) kimchi were my favorites. I also loved the flavor of the dongchimi. My favorite of the meats was the Jowl- better than the brisket.\n\nWe got really lucky and found street parking (free metered spot because it was Sunday). However refer to the photos for the small driveway off of Harvard into the Harvard Plaza parking. There is only valet available in the lot for $4 if you pay cash and $5 if you pay card. The parking lot is one way so when you exit you will exit off of 6th.",
      "My first two dishes were so awful that i could give a rating of 2-3 stars, but the primed marianted short rib was fantastic. The Tongue and Beef with sprout are to be honest 2/5 no cap. I came here because of the review but was quite disappointed.  I know that after reading my reviews its confusing because i gave an overall of 4/5. The reason is because after i met my korean friend and told him about this place and my experience. He told me Ahgassi Gopchang is an INTESTINES specialty restaurant.  My fault for ordering something out of their recommendations.\n\nbefore i went inside restaurants, there was a group of arabs who came out the shop and said\nPerson 1:this place taste bad. how come people come here\nPerson 2: bro, its not even halal. Its not worth it.\n\nYep, i probably ordered like them, but like i said its our fault for not doing research about the restaurant beforehand.",
      "Was a little worried about being accommodated going solo, but service was phenomenal.\n\nAll of the food I had was top notch. Really enjoyed the beef intestines and japchae; table side service for grilling was stellar!",
      "We enjoyed the Korean BBQ. We were overwhelmed by the number of the side dishes! It was a joy eating here. The meat was of premium quality!"

      "Everything at MDK was great. From the service to the food. The dumplings were amazing and better than the ones I tried in Seoul. The wrapper was thin, just enough to hold the delicious and juicy pork filling. We got the cold green noodles. Perfect balance of spicy and noodles were nice and chewy. Definitely will be back.",
      "Another fantastic restaurant in K-town, the food here is made with care and super high quality. If you\u2019re craving a hearty noodle or dumpling dish this is your place.\n\nWe ordered their signature noodle soup as well as an order of their homemade dumplings and each plate was big enough to share so family style is recommended here. Our dishes came with a sides of kimchi which paired nicely as the spice complimented the meal well.\n\nThe inside was spacious and clean. The staff came around multiple times to refill our cups. There is also plenty of parking nearby in a garage or on the street.\n\nWill definitely be back and keep this place in my K-town rotation.",
      "Highly Highly recommend this place! This is the second time I\u2019ve been, and I will definitely be back. The spicy kimchi is amazing and the cold green chlorella noodles are perfection, especially refreshing on a hot day.",
      "This place is bright and clean with lots of seating. We waited about 5 minutes before we got seated in a party of 5. I def recommend ordering the food family style bc the portions are shareable and huge.\n\nThe majority of us couldn\u2019t finish our bowl of noodles. The pan fried dumplings were pretty good. The kimchi is a little bit on the spicy side. So if you get any of the spicy dishes, it\u2019s about the same level of spicy.",
      "I love their noodles so much. It was my first tome trying their spicy menu and woah, no joke, it was soooo spicy that I couldn\u2019t eat much. I\u2019m not saying it is bad, it was amazing actually but I just can\u2019t handle spicy food very well. I\u2019m going to stick to my regular noodle, but I\u2019m glad I tried. Especially Jjolmyeon, try if you can handle their spicy level. It was an amazing one bite for me and my friend finished it and paid for it the next day iykyk lol. Their kimchi pancake is amazing! Not that spicy and perfectly seasoned. Their dumplings are the best in ktown btw in my personal opinion."

      "Absolutely loved my experience at this Korean BBQ restaurant! The food here is top-notch, and the service is great! We tried the small beef combo, and it was more than enough for two people! The meat was tender and flavorful, and grilling it at the table added to the fun. Daniel's attentive service made our dining experience even more enjoyable. The ambiance was lively, and we had a fantastic time. Highly recommend this place for anyone craving delicious Korean BBQ!",
      "I love this place! I was recommend by my friend that they have really good meat. And I was so obsessed with Korean bbq. We ordered marinated short ribs and it was soooooo good. The size is large and we were so satisfied!! We also had seafood pancake as well as ramen, they were also good. I love how they serve us, the environment was nice at there. Will definitely come back again and try something out different:))",
      "Highly recommended!!\nWe didn't order a set meal, although the set meals looked quite good, they just weren't what I wanted. So, we decided to order separately. Here's what we ordered:\n1. Beef tongue (can be ordered as a half portion)\n2. Pork neck meat (can be ordered as a half portion)\n3. Fish cake soup (must-order! Extremely refreshing)\n4. Beef intestines (very tasty, but a bit fatty for me)\n5. Snowflake pork (can be ordered as a half portion)\n-\nAlthough the beef intestines were the star, I have to say... their snowflake pork was amazing! So tender! Even someone like me, who isn't particularly fond of beef, thought it was delicious! Highly recommended! The staff grill it for you the whole time, so you just have to wait to eat \ud83d\ude48",
      "Since ktown's pine crane collapsed, I've found a Korean BBQ that serves grilled beef intestines and barbecue \ud83e\udd70\n\n\ud83c\udf1fBeef combo You can't go wrong with this combo, which has fat and Short ribs and a soup of your choice. Fat cow can dip cheese \ud83e\uddc0, can be shredded. Short ribs are really not too fragrant with garlic. The texture of these ribs is very obvious \ud83d\ude0b\n\n\ud83c\udf1f I am most greedy for roast fat sausage, because I want spicy, so I first order this sauce. Sizzling with bean sprouts and scallion oil, it's a real treat. But I still get tired of eating too much. Try it without sauce next time\n\n\ud83c\udf1f seafood cake material really quite a lot, sweet and crisp. Their steamed eggs are cooked on the spot for you in a small stove in front of you, which is the first time I have seen.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f When I come to the store on weekdays, it is always full of people, and on weekends, there is a queue of people. I heard that Korean stars will also come to punch in!",
      "The food and vibe here is amazing. The intestines combo tastes so good! Daniel was very helpful and took good care of our table. Highly recommended the beef stomach and large intestines. The valet parking is kinda weird. I self parked and they charged me 5 bucks and totally self-served unlike other town plaza, which they usually take care of your car when you enter the plaza."

      "This place is thriving, but my experience wasn't the best. The decor is outdated with cracked seats, my table had streaks of oil around, with uncleaned grill, and the ventilated air smelled like wet socks. The server kept lowering the heat while the meat was still being cooked, to probably avoid the grill getting charred, the prolonged cooking made the meat very chewy.\n\nThe marinated meat was good, but the owner really should invest on the interior. Not the first Korean Barbecue place I would go to, or the second, or the third.",
      "Ordered the Galbi, cold noodles and soup for dinner.  Quality of the Galbi was very good but it was pricy.  Our waiter was an expert at grilling it patiently and cut it up for us.  The hilight for the dinner was the cold noodles.  It was light, refreshing and the noodles were so chewy and delicious.   It's best to eat this as soon as it arrives otherwise the texture of the noodles change as it sits in the broth.  The soup was average.  Parking in the small lot is Valet.",

It comes with 5 incredible meats including brisket, short rib, pork belly and marinated bone in and bone less short rib. They also have spicy cold noodles so I couldn\u2019t resist. My must order is the saam set because I love making lettuce and perilla wraps with the meat. Their meat quality is pretty good and they come out juicy. Also a big plus that they cook for you here and they have a limited parking lot",

We were off to a fantastic evening. The wait was short, the atmosphere was great. The food is 5-stars. But come time to wrap up and pay, the young man was not as attentive as he was while cooking the food. It took a little while longer to get the bill. Once I flagged him down to get the check, as soon as he placed it on the table, he disappeared for a long while. The wife went to the restroom, did her thing, returned, and still no signs of the waiter to charge us. We could have left, wondering if he would have even noticed. But I have integrity. I patiently waited. I asked the wife flagged him down. And finally he brought over the CC machine. Yikes, what a terrible ending.",

      "As we drove into Koreatown we were underwhelmed with the neighborhood. So much trash everywhere.\n\nWe had made an early dinner reservation and arrived early and they were beyond accommodating\n\nThis place is the real deal. And worth the hype and money\n\nThere were 3 of us dining so we got the bbq sampler for 2 and a stewed black cod dish..a specialty of the house.\n\nI did not want to get the cod \u2026 but I was outvoted. It was great and an individualized dish. It was great !!!\n\nWe finished it all and would without a shadow of a doubt return to Parks BBQ again !!!\n\nPro Tip - go before the dinner rush and make a reservation. Parking in KTown is bonkers so absolutely use the valet offered by Parks BBQ.  It was $4 and worth every penny",
      "The korean BBQ here is to die for. The meat is melt in your mouth and is very juicy. The banchan is also very delicious. The servers cook the meat for you and they\u2019re very fast too! The seafood pancake wasn\u2019t anything special though and wouldn\u2019t really recommend it. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come again if I\u2019m in the area."

      "Worth every dollar! We had the happy hour cheeseburger combo and will come back for a shake. Park across the street, 2 hours validated parking for $15, quick and safe area. The onion rings and wedge salad are delicious. Definitely a high quality restaurant with the best in class service.",
      "This restaurant is a pleasant surprise for us.  We came in since it's connected to the hotel we're staying for the night.\nWe had breakfast.  The specialty coffee was great, latte.  French toast had just a perfect crunch without tasting burnt.  It's not overly sweet but punch with good flavors.\nI don't eat breakfast but decided to order over-easy eggs.  Perfectly cooked!  And glad Nick offered me salsa (it was a great salsa) as I enjoyed my eggs even more \u2764\ufe0f it came with amazingly crunchy toast and jam.\nAnd mom enjoyed her omelet.\nWhat I enjoyed so much about this place is how a simple order (like an egg or a toast) was perfectly executed!\nGreat service as well!!!\nI would have try to come back here for dinner but I live in Florida.\nDoing this reviews to let local people know that it's worth a try.",
      "Cassell's Hamburgers impresses with its classic interior design and the lively, friendly service from the staff.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the quarter-pound burger, which uniquely comes with sauce served on the side. The sauce itself is bold and tangy, based on Thousand Island dressing with a distinct pickle flavor.\n\nIt's worth trying the burger first without the sauce to truly appreciate the rich flavor of the meat. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch burger experience!",
      "I really enjoy visiting old and historic places, and I believe that Hotel Normandie is one of the oldest places in LA, Cassell's is located right on the corner.\nUnfortunately, finding a parking spot in K Town can be a bit challenging, but once we made it inside Cassell's for breakfast, it was a great experience.\nThe quality of the ingredients was apparent, and the warm and inviting ambiance of Cassell's added to the overall experience.\nIt had a classic diner vibe, and the staff were friendly and provided excellent service throughout my visit.",
      "It\u2019s not open for 24 hours as it said.\nThe burger was great, juicy and full of flavor.\nThe French fries were horrible, it was soaked in oil and i couldn\u2019t eat it.\nI didn\u2019t get the quality for the price and the good tip i paid.\nAlso try to order from a delivery service because it\u2019s impossible to find a parking lot on the street"

      "Love love love this place! I had the Korean bbq spare ribs on a food tour years ago and have been a fan ever since! The sides that come along with this order are also very delicious. I always make time to enjoy a sit down dinner here when I am in town. The environment is perfect for family or solo dining and the food never misses! I would recommend this place over and over again. 10/10 \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe",
      "Nestled amidst the unassuming streets of Koreatown, a culinary gem awaits. Forget the grand facades and trendy interiors - this is a hole-in-the-wall haven, radiating pure, unadulterated flavor. Imagine a cozy space, no bigger than 1000 square feet, where an open kitchen throbs with energy. Just one server and two dedicated cooks orchestrate a symphony of sizzling meats and bubbling stews, their passion evident in every dish.\n\nHere, Korean BBQ transcends mere sustenance. It's an experience that ignites the soul. The star of the show is undoubtedly the pork, each morsel grilled to perfection, boasting a symphony of textures - a crisp char yielding to melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, bursting with smoky, savory goodness. Every bite transports you to Korean BBQ nirvana.\n\nBut the magic doesn't stop there. This is a flavor feast, and the supporting cast of banchan (side dishes) shines just as brightly. While the absence of kimchi might raise an eyebrow for some, the diverse spread of other delights ensures your palate remains tantalized.\n\nSure, parking might be a bit of a challenge, but trust me, it's a hurdle worth overcoming. The friendly, no-frills atmosphere and incredibly affordable prices only add to the charm. This is Korean BBQ stripped down to its delicious core, a testament to the power of quality ingredients and culinary passion.\n\nIn short:\n\nHidden gem: Tucked away in Koreatown, offering an authentic experience.\nIntimate space: Cozy and casual, with an open kitchen showcasing culinary craftsmanship.\nStar of the show: Korean pork BBQ cooked to perfection, bursting with flavor.\nSupporting cast: Diverse and delicious banchan side dishes.\nAffordable delight: Great value for your money.\nMinor quibble: Lack of kimchi, but other options compensate.\nIs this a place you'd be eager to try?",
      "Wow! The best Korean BBQ pork ribs, pork neck stew, and stone kimchi fried rice in the world, outside of South Korea. Yes, I said it! In The world outside of South Korea.",
      "Their pork spare rib is amazing with the hint of charcoal grill smell. The soybean paste stew is also delicious and side dishes are pretty good as well. Staffs are okay - not like kinder side and I felt like not being served well but it looks like they are pretty busy. The cleanliness of table and silverwares can also be better. The valet parking is a must with $3.",
      "These ribs are the best ribs ever. The char is perfect and flavor is unmistakable. The layer of raw onion that gets caramelized under the heat of the ribs is genius. The flavor and juices from the ribs makes the onions super delicious, & together, it\u2019s an unbeatable combination. I like that they serve barley tea in place of water. Barley tea has a subtle nutty, almond-like flavor. It\u2019s served cold & is very refreshing. It compliments the ribs & onions very well. The place is a little cramped, but clean & has a nice outdoor patio as well. The service was good, but they\u2019re almost always busy."

      "This place has great strawberry sando. I went around 12pm just the right time when the sandoes are out. The strawberries are very fresh. They also have other katsu dishes like rice plate or katsu sando. The desserts here are great too. I just love every menu here! One thing is that parking is valet and it\u2019s not free (unless you do pick up).",
      "Wow. Incredible food. Just what I needed. A bit of sweet and some spice. LARGE portion, I mean take a look at this sandwich! The chicken came out the backside of the bun like an inch.\n\nFried Mushrooms were 6/10. I thought they could use a new special sauce to really make them stand out being a type of food you don\u2019t normally eat at a casual dine-in spot.\nAnd the waffle fries really have that \u201cfried food\u201d taste to them. Like, greasy. :/ good, but it\u2019s a lot..\n\nOverall though, 9/10. Yup. I\u2019ll be coming a few more times to try different meals because the price is great on top of the fact the meals look great, too.",
      "Fiery Delight from Katsu Bar via Door Dash!\n\nI just ordered the most scrumptious Pork Curry Katsu extra spicy from Katsu Bar, delivered right to my doorstep by DoorDash! This mouth-watering dish came with a delightful assortment of sides, including steamed rice, arugula salad, pickled radish, and macaroni salad.\n\nThe curry sauce was the real star of the show - fiery hot and full of flavor! It perfectly complemented the crispy, juicy pork katsu. Each bite was a harmonious balance of spice and savory goodness.\n\nThe sides were all delicious and fresh, providing a nice contrast to the richness of the curry. The steamed rice was fluffy, the arugula salad was peppery and crisp, the pickled radish added a nice tang, and the macaroni salad was creamy and sweet.\n\nOverall, I'm thoroughly impressed with Katsu Bar\u2019s Pork Curry Katsu. If you're a fan of spicy food, look no further. Order now and enjoy the flavor explosion!",
      "I love this place! The spicy chicken sandwiches are amazing. Would have given 5 stars but yesterday I got an Apple chili chicken sandwich and found a bit of debris resting on the chicken breast (see images). Seems to be some sort of metal shaving? Anyway I removed it and went on eating and didn\u2019t have any other issues. I suppose this is mostly a note for the staff to check up on kitchen protocols and whatnot.",
      "I'm a big fan of their portobello mushroom sandwich--fresh, huge,  incredibly juicy and flavorful. The best veggie sandwich I've ever had! The Katsu Ramen soup is rich, flavorful, with perfect noodles and spot-on katsu chicken. The curry is creamy and rich, bursting with flavor. The strawberry Sando, has a lot of cream! Super creamy, just the right sweetness for fellow cream lovers  and it tastes incredibly fresh.\n\nKatsubar mixes Japanese and Korean flavors with a modern twist. They use fancy breadcrumbs with rosemary salt to make tastier, healthier katsu. Hand-breaded and cooked perfectly, crispy outside and juicy inside. I was super satisfied with my meal. Can't believe how good they are still.\n\nService is super sweet, friendly and fast. The decor is very modern, large glass window brought a lot of sunlight in, feels super relaxing dining in. Solid 5 stars, can't wait to come back for their amazing sando again!"

      "We are tourists, this is our first time visiting this restaurant.  I just googled \u201cthe best Korean food in LA\u201d then it pop up.\nAs online reservation requires your credit card pay first, we decided go there by walk-in.  We arrive around 730pm, it was full house.  We waiting about 30 mins to be seated.  The restaurant is cramped but you won\u2019t feel uncomfortable.\nWe ordered 3 main specialties - short rib, raw crab and black cod.  All the dishes are palatable and fit into our taste.  Although it\u2019s a bit pricey but worth.\nBTW, I saw some comments said that there discrimination but I don't think so.  We are Asian but not speak Korean, the servers are very busy but keep friendly.  You just need to be kind and patient.",
      "Soy Crab \ud83d\udcaf\n\nPeople often compare SoCal and NorCal when it comes to food cuisine, price and quality\n\nThe truth is that the LA area has a significantly higher population (3.8 million vs 1.5 million for the SF Bay Area) that often leads to increased competition and diversity\n\nOne area where there is little argument that LA beats SF is soy marinated raw crabs, a Korean delicacy, with almost no consistent availability in the SF Bay Area\n\nI stopped by Soban, a quaint and low-key restaurant that is frequently named as one of LA\u2019s best Korean spots for raw crab\n\nTheir banchan is frequently cited for both the colors and the variety with twelve dishes for our meal\n\nThe raw crab was modest in size similar to smaller crabs used in Korea and the flavor was outstanding, extremely fresh without being too salty and perfect with rice\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Braised Short Rib $50 ~ Galbi Jjim / Braised Black Cod $50 / Soy Marinated Raw Crab $61\n\n\ud83d\udccdSoban (Los Angeles, CA)\n\nDining is indoor only and reservations are available.  Service is polite and friendly and credit cards are accepted.",
      "I think in the past this restaurant served very well done dishes since I saw a lot of good reviews. Just from the way the banchan was made I can see there is lack of attention to ensure best taste and freshness of ingredients. Basics are missed. Kimchi was quite awful. Other banchan were afterthoughts and were very bland and no flavor. Cod fish dish was good, tofu pancake was dry and the sauce that comes with it was simply too salty to use. Bulgogi was overcooked and it was way too salty. In the end the head hostess didn\u2019t even say bye as we left. This is a major disrespect for Korean culture. Also the dishes are quite expensive and sadly the dishes and service do not justify. I hope things will improve for them.",
      "Amazing Korean restaurant. Super down to earth and incredible food. Friendly staff which you sometimes wouldn\u2019t expect at a little place like this but everything was great. Super good banchan and the braised cod was perfect.",
      "After seeing Soban's enticing Instagram post, I decided to take my friends there for our quarterly outing. Unfortunately, our experience left much to be desired. While I understand that Korean restaurants in downtown Los Angeles are primarily known for their delicious cuisine rather than service, our encounter was exceptionally poor.\nThe server addressed us solely in Korean, even though only two out of our group of six spoke Korean, and she saw the 2 translating everything she said. Moreover, she was abrupt, impolite, and neglected basic service tasks like refilling our water glasses. When we attempted to capture a group photo, she intervened, citing other customers' aversion to being photographed. Eventually, she reluctantly took the picture, but it had at least five customers next to us, whom I had to manually edit out later.\nRegarding the food, we ordered a variety of dishes, including Braised Short Ribs, Braised Black Cod, Mackerel with soybean soup, and Kimchi Stew. While the short ribs were passable, they lacked seasoning. The Black Cod, however, was flavorful. The mackerel was mediocre, and both the soybean soup and kimchi stew were disappointingly bland.\nDespite its small size, the restaurant seemed to attract a predominantly non-Korean clientele, which did not surprise us. Suffice it to say, we won't be returning to Soban anytime soon. It appears that placing trust in an Instagram post was a mistake \ud83d\ude15"

True to form, the Chun Ju Bean Sprout Soup was exceptional. The rich contents and presentation of the simmering soup tantalized our taste buds, evoking memories of authentic Chun Ju-style cuisine. What's more, the owner, who has been with the restaurant since its inception, warmly recognized my brother, a longtime patron, leaving us deeply impressed. For an authentic taste of Chun Ju cuisine, look no further than Chun Ju Han Il Karan.",

      "So disappointed with this place. The corn cheese is served in aluminum foil, there was no steamed egg, no sauce plate unless you asked, and the cuts of meat were low quality.\n\nWe had a party of five sharing one grill limited to three orders per round. We felt like we were nibbling the whole time.\n\nThere are better options and experiences for the price.",
      "When in LA\u2019s Koreatown and you really want that iconically delicious All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ experience for a good price, you absolutely need to come to Bulgogi Hut. Bulgogi Hut is a family-owned business in Koreatown that really hits the bullseye for a well-rounded experience in price, wide array of menu options, and of course, deliciousness!\n\nMake sure to also ask for Sandra as your server, as she will really make sure you get the best sampling of everything. She helped us grill all of our meat to perfection and even gave us suggestions on her favorite things to order. You will be walking out of here happily full with a great taste in your mouth (literally) and having had a good time.\n\nI like to talk out-of-town visitors and even local friends here and usually get the Deluxe meal for $36 per person\u2014a steal. But if you really wanna splurge a bit, I highly suggest also going for the Premium menu option for $48 a person! It comes with premium options such as their 21-day aged bone-in short rib and premium ribeye steak.\n\nThey have a great selection of Korean side dishes that is the mark of a great spot like cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, japchae, miso soup, tofu soup, steamed egg, and so much more. Pro tip: Don\u2019t order a side of rice because you\u2019ll be wanting to eat everything else and leave room for all that meat, because rice will just fill you up.\n\nI also suggest ordering some of their yogurt soju options, especially the peach flavor, as it\u2019s refreshing and will pair so well with the rich meat. Having gone here many times, my favorite way to end each meal is to order the cinnamon sugar pineapple. It\u2019s the right amount of sweetness and a great finale to the feast!",
      "My fiance and I decided to try a new place other than our usual spot and we weren't impressed. The staff was super nice, and our server was always asking if we needed anything else. So in that sense I gave it 5 stars for service. When it came to the food options it was lacking. We order thin slice beef belly which was good, same with the spicy chicken, but when it came to the pork, it lacked flavor. We got pork belly, and garlic pork which was super salty.",
      "It's a straightforward all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ joint with quick service and seating. While it may not be top-tier, it's definitely a fun experience if you're not too particular. However, parking is scarce and somewhat sketchy. I witnessed a couple of guys devouring food as if they were competing champions, and the server didn't seem to mind if they cleaned out the entire place.",

We ended up coming to Anju House and are so happy we did.\n\nThe portions are big and for the price I think it's very reasonable. The food was well spiced and tasted good.

      "It's a quaint and very dog-friendly spot. It has plenty of seating and offers an array of food options. If you've been here before when it was called \"Yellow House,\" you'll notice the similarity in the menu. It's a perfect lunch/dinner for groups and families. My human ordered the Fried Chicken and Green Onion, and it was delicious! It's definitely a must-try! The chicken is crispy, and the green onion salad was very refreshing. The sauce it came with was okay, but you don't need it. Service could improve.",
      "Super quaint and cute spot in ktown!! Valet parking, or street meters. The restaurant is a blue house \u2014 at first it was confusing to find the entrance but then you realize it is right in front of you \u2014 it\u2019s built like a house and once you go in it\u2019s an open space. The interior is super cute and aesthetic, there\u2019s flies that come out towards the evening but they have fly swatters on the table. The food portion sizes are mid-size, to borderline small but enough to fill you up. I definitely recommend sharing family style so you can try everything on the menu! We had The kimchi bacon pasta and the bulgogi with a side ban Chan - the banchan was two dishes, radishes and kimchi, at $1.95. The bulgogi was sweet and good, as expected taste, and the kimchi bacon pasta was good as well. They didn\u2019t overdo it with the kimchi or bacon so it\u2019s easy to not taste either one if you are sharing. Overall the food was good, the service was good, the atmosphere was amazing and the interior design was amazing so it deserved up to four stars for that. Would recommend coming here for a group hang or catch up!!"

Yes, they have a late night happy hour menu.\n\nWe're going back.",
      "Had my birthday dinner here and the staff took such good care of us! The atmosphere is excellent --- It feels relaxed, yet still upscale, and the food was fantastic. Highly recommend!",
      "Very good, very attentive. We had a bigger party so we pre ordered everything. Loved the hamachi- but pretty much all the dishes were good. Get the drinks! Loved my fruity cocktails.",
      "Simply stunning experience. Every meal and cocktail is a balanced masterpiece, and the service is expert. Elliot made our meal flow perfectly with memorable recommendations and graceful patience with our pickiness on wine temperature. Highly recommend, will be telling all my friends and coming back!"

      "After a day out in Los Angeles, we decided to dine at this restaurant, and it turned out to be a delightful culinary journey. We opted for the Hansang Jeongsik with LA Galbi, Kkotge Doenjang Jjigae, and Grilled Fish, accompanied by an array of delectable banchan (side dishes).\n\nThe LA Galbi was a revelation\u2014perfectly grilled, tender, and infused with a savory marinade that made every bite a burst of flavor. The Kkotge Doenjang Jjigae (soybean paste stew with crab) was a standout dish, with a rich and robust broth that perfectly complemented the sweetness of the crab, creating a deeply satisfying flavor profile. The grilled fish was expertly cooked, with a crispy exterior and moist, flaky interior, complemented by a hint of lemon.\n\nThe variety of banchan included everything from crisp, fresh greens to pickled delicacies, each adding its unique taste and texture to the meal. Every dish was prepared with care and presented beautifully.\n\nThe ambiance of this restaurant is equally impressive. The interior is modern yet cozy, with ample natural light flooding through large windows. The clean, sleek design is enhanced by touches of rustic charm, such as the wooden elements and tastefully arranged d\u00e9cor. The dining area is spacious, providing both comfort and privacy for a relaxed dining experience.\n\nService was impeccable. The staff were attentive, patient, and eager to ensure we had everything we needed, contributing significantly to our pleasant dining experience.\n\nThis Michelin-starred restaurant offers an exotic atmosphere that enhances the culinary delights. It provides not just a meal, but a memorable dining experience, making it a must-visit spot in Los Angeles. Highly recommended for food lovers of all ages!",
      "Came here before watching a movie at cgv cinema and it was totally worth it. Got sat right away and was met with impeccable service. The meat was cooked for us and the side dishes were great. Only downside was the bartender wasn\u2019t available so couldn\u2019t order cocktails. Would recommend and definitely will come again!",
      "Nice interior. Elevated quality. Came here for lunch. There is a special lunch menu for weekdays. The spicy octopus stone pot bibimbap was good, but fairly standard. I\u2019ve heard the beef tartare (yukhoe) bibimbap is good here. Overall, nice meal. A little pricier to match the more upscale interior.",
      "We loved every food we ordered! My favorite is their tartare! When I visit Cali again I will definitely come back here. Their place looks so fancy and I love the kind of ambience they have in their. Service crew were all very nice.",
      "After going to Seoul, we were on the hunt for good quality meat KBBQ. Though pricey the meat quality was good. However the service was not existent.\n\nThere were only 3-5 tables with guests at the restaurant. We waited for the server to take orders and he wouldn\u2019t come back despite us wanting to put in more orders. He said they only have one person in the back grabbing food. Would have been nice if he checked in on the guests more since there was several other servers too and guests were trying to wave down the servers for orders. Very odd when the restaurant was practically empty."

      "I decided to try out this location after visiting one in Buena Park. The interior design here was quite similar to the Buena Park location, and it brought back memories of traditional Korean homes, known as \ud55c\uc625\uc9d1. The parking situation can be a bit challenging when the restaurant is full. We ordered two servings of pork soup with Korean sausage and rice (\uc21c\ub300\uad6d\ubc25), a scallion pancake (\ubd80\ucd94\uc804) to share, and a hot stone bibimbap. As expected, everything was delicious, and the side dishes were even better than those at the Buena Park location. The atmosphere was pleasant, and the service met our expectations.",
      "The menu is very straightforward and that is far from a bad thing. You go in and know exactly what to expect and it is so comforting and delicious!! The variety of banchan is definitely house made and worth it alone for a visit!",
      "Quick to take order after getting a table, which in my mind is one of important qualities to have as Korean restaurant lol. Got the pork soup and pork soup with korean blood sausage. If you like Korean blood sausage, def would recommend the soup with blood sausage. Took me maybe 2 and a half spoons of salt and a bit of \uc0c8\uc6b0\uc813, but remember to season your soup! Very hearty and tasty. You could taste the bone broth soup is really rich. Oh but their napa cabbage kimchi game was weak.. but their radish kimchi is not bad.",
      "The soon dea soup was so delicious, the broth is flavorful!! I would love it if they have purple rice. I also love the korean style pancakes as well. It was crispy and salty! I give five stars!!",
      "The server recommended yukgaejang to us and honestly, it was the best I\u2019d ever had. I would even say life changing. Really good food and traditional vibes all around!"

      "A cozy restaurant with nice staff. I enjoy the atmosphere it has as it gave off a warm place to enjoy food and drinks with friends. The gentleman who served us was incredibly nice, and due to the fact that we were new to an establishment like this, he was very helpful in explaining what food items were in the dishes, how the heat level is on them and how the items were shareable here. When my dish came out, I was amazed by the sizes of my dish and my friends. It looked amazing, smelled and tasted amazing. What a lovely experience and I can't wait to experience this lovely place again and try other dishes. I hope anyone who sees this review will also take the time to enjoy this restaurant.",
      "I love all the menus here! The food portion was so good, and they are known for the Korean style pancakes,very savory and delicious and crispy! You can get free ice cream after your meal!",
      "Update with photos:  back in LA, for another round of soju and pork belly.  I saw they have new summer items.  If you wany yo try Korean cold noodles, I'm certain they do it well here.  Will try to get pics next time.\n\nHole in the wall Korean joint, great for locals, family, and friends.\n\nFood is great, service is friendly.  Typically get the sliced pork dish (bossam, pronounced boh-sahm), or anything fried.  Of course the soju and beer lineup is great.  Also, very clean and welcoming decor with wooden interior.  They have combos to try, but never hesitate to ask the servers their recommendations as they all speak English.  Can't wait to try their budaejigae (soldier's soup).",
      "This restaurant was so cozy and has the best authentic Korean food. Very worth the drive. Definitely bring your friends because the servings are huge and are meant to be shared. Very decently priced for the amount of food you get. You have to push the little button on the wall for service. Highly recommend this place.",
      "Amazing shareable food and drinks. Delicious and authentic Korean comfort food. The service is fast, and efficient. There is a call button to call over your server. The vibes are immaculate, with it's Sakura theme and K-pop playing in the background, it's a perfect place to hangout with friends. I had the army stew, tbbboki, potato pancakes, and the assorted pancake platter along with 1 bottle of soju and 1 bottle of black berry wine for a total of 144$ split between 6 people the meal broke down to $25 pp. And we had leftovers. So worth every penny."

      "We found this place by chance. When we got the menu I was skeptical of the fruit with the fried chicken. We ordered the soy garlic chicken and was it fantastic. The breading was crispy and the fruit with the sauces balanced well. I would highly recommend this place and can\u2019t wait to come back. Also, one order is enough for two people.",
      "This has to be the perfectly balanced fried chicken I\u2019ve had. The batter for the chicken is very light so it wasn\u2019t overpowering to the taste of the chicken but it still gave the pieces the perfect crunch! The chicken was also still juicy after being fried.\n\nThe sauces were amazing, my favorite was the chili sauce, it paired really well with the fruit, especially the strawberries.\n\nAlthough we arrived before it got busy.\nThe service is fast! People that would order to go would get their orders within minutes same with people dining in.\n\nThis is a place I have to come back soon whenever I feel like having fried chicken.",
      "Awesome food! We got the Director's Cut Special Edition for 4 people to share, and we almost finished it so the portion is super generous. The chicken skin is super crispy and the meat is tender (our favorites were the soy and the mustard). The whole place is run by a single man who was super sweet and did korean hearts to us! You have to try it out!",
      "Ok, so I generally only leave reviews if I\u2019m absolutely wowed by an experience and that\u2019s absolutely what I got here at Gol Tong Chicken! This delightful shop is a labor of love from the proprietor/chef Gol Tong, who is also of note for being the director of several Korean films, the posters of which decorate the space in the restaurant. There is a whole sound booth in here and many other wonderful quirks - it\u2019s really something. The reason why you\u2019ll be back though is his food! It\u2019s out of this world good - incredibly fresh, perfectly seasoned/sauced Korean fried chicken, the best I\u2019ve had in LA and I\u2019ve tried all of them! Go for The Director\u2019s Cut option on the menu and bring at least two friends to split it with, because this is an exceptionally generous portion! It comes with two sublime sauces for dipping and the whole platter is layered with fresh fruit and veggies. It\u2019s a work of art befitting its name! Highly, highly recommended and I\u2019m super excited to come back here again!",
      "After a hike, we went to Gol Tong for late lunch and did not even realize that we stepped into a gem. The founder and owner is the only one managing this place! He cooks and serves the food for everyone which was such an incredible experience. The wings came out fresh with fruits included!!! This is the first time we've had wings with fresh fruits! Haha we got half and half to try both flavors. 10/10 must try "

The sesame, red pepper and garlic were my favorites, but each were really delicious. The service was very quick and very friendly making sure we had enough water to drink with our meal. Definitely want to come back when we are in town.",
      "Heads up, pork belly fans! Eight Korean BBQ now offers all-you-can-eat pork belly with 8 flavorful options and tasty kimchi stew. The pork has a deliciously different texture and flavor, hitting the spot every time. Shoutout to the attentive servers who ensure your grilling game is on point. However, the water has a strange metallic taste that's a bit off-putting. One round of pork belly is plenty to satisfy your hunger. If you're craving pork belly, this is definitely the spot to check out! \ud83c\udf56",
      "We got the premium beef combo, and it came with a seafood soup as well as a huge variety of side dishes. The meat was alright, but compared to other KBBQ restaurants in Ktown LA, it is definitely lower in quality.",
      "There wasn\u2019t a wait on a Friday night for our group. The server was great despite our large group. He was quick, to take orders and cooking at our two grills.\n\nHowever the meat quality was disappointing and the meat tasted frozen and lacked flavor slightly better than the meat quality at Gen. It definitely looks good but unfortunately the meat flavor wasn\u2019t there.\n\nThe chairs were stools with no backing which was not comfortable. Completely okay for the authentic experience but wished the meat quality was better as I had high hopes for this place.",
      "One of the best pork belly in K-town! A lot of food and you are enjoying their different flavors of pork belly, such as salty, spicy, curry, and more.  They serve your meats and you cook with your grill. Very entertaining. Satisfied!"

Service is excellent, servers try their best to cook for you which is rare for where I\u2019m from - Vancouver Canada where most restaurants let you cook for yourself and you have to tip them - make no sense for me lol.\n\nMeat is fresh, but I just would like to see more options for dipping sauce.\n\nHad a good dinner here.

      "Like what others said, the soup broth is really delicious. I think the seafood kalguksu is better than the chicken broth, and its more worth the price. I really like spicy soup base but this is only available for seafood. Some of the seafood I am allergic to so I couldn't order that. They gave so much noodles that made it challenging to finish for 1 person. It will be so much better if they could offer a smaller portion than to waste food like that. Taking away a soup noodle won't taste good.\n\nThere isn't much atmosphere as the place is extremely noisy to the point that you can't hear the person opposite of you.\n\nIt is a very popular place and the dinner lines goes on until they close the restaurant but the waiting time is not very long.",
      "One of the favorites of a New York foodies friend of ours - finally got to try it and absolutely love it! All the items are delicious - bulgogi was rich in flavor and tender in texture, with so much veggie; the clam noodle has a great soup base, chewy noodle and a good amount of clams; pork belly was tender and goes well with the pickled cabbage and spicy kimchi radish. The utensils go well with the table top. The line was descent at 1pm but moved very fast (~15 minutes of wait). They even started taking orders when we were ready, so food was ready shortly after we were seated. Definitely will return and highly recommend!",

The tables and chairs don't have much flair. It felt like a cafeteria. Every table is close to each other, so it's an intimate dining experience. If you can get past that, the food makes you forget about the sterile like environment.

      "Fantastic flavours, great service, and reasonable pricing. I see why this place is so highly recommended.\n\nThe inside is unassuming, but bustling with many guests.\n\nOf note, the combo soontofu is a small bowl, so if you\u2019re attempting to do family style it may feed 2 people + your main protein. The soontofu is very rich in flavor, and some of the best we\u2019ve had - compared to Toronto. They give a good variety of banchan and will refill as requested. The kimchi was a bit sweet, very fresh, and much less salty/fishy.\n\nThey have free parking behind the restaurant that fits close to 20 vehicles and plenty of street parking in front.\n\nThis will be a staple whenever we visit LA",
      "Wonderful authentic Korean food. My friend recommended this place and was very glad that I tried it! The establishment isn't flashy and could easily be overlooked, but once you enter, you can tell that the restaurant is very good due to the fact that it was packed in there. There was a constant flow of people entering and exiting. We ordered the bibembop on a hot bowl. The side dishes were amazing and instead of water, we were given a pitcher of cold green tea. Loved that! Service was wonderful and the food was tasty and delicious!",
      "It brings tears to my eyes as I write this review on the eve of my move out of LA. I\u2019ve probably eaten here over 50 times in the last 10 years and can confidently say this is a top 3 favorite restaurant in SoCal for me. Surawon is not your fancy \u201cpinkies up\u201d type of place. It is the home to the most delicious, authentic and welcoming Korean food that only a Korean mom and grandma with decades of excellence, love, and care can produce.\n\nThe star is the thick-cut Galbi - smoky, sweet, savory, and incredibly juicy from what can only be premium, highly marbled beef. The other star is the large offering of banchan - each executed perfectly and with a different flavor profile that can balance any meal. Of course the brand is centered on the soondubu, which blends a rich and flavorful broth with generous portion of fresh tofu.\n\nThe service is truly 5/5. It didn\u2019t matter if the restaurant was full or empty, the ajummas always served you with a smile and made sure your banchans were replenished.\n\nAfter so many meals here, I can go on for a very long time about the great memories I\u2019ve had at Surawon. But I\u2019ll stop and let whoever is reading this make their own memories and hope that when I come back in a few years, this wonderful place is still around, unchanged.",
      "I was traveling and wanted to get some soon tofu and this place was excellent.\n\nComing from Utah, where Korean cuisine has gotten ridiculously expensive for the mid-tier quality, this place was amazing and reasonably priced (though I'm not sure how it compares to the rest of LA).\n\nI thought the service was great too and will be back."

      "I normally make my own steaks because no steak house makes them nearly as good as I do. Went to Taylor's steak house, and they had American Wagyu steak. I must say that I was surprised: the steak met and exceeded my expectations. The steak was moist and cooked exactly how I wanted it (see pics). I had it with Asparagus and wild rice. All was marvelous. The price was very reasonable. The service was no less than great.. I do have to add this comment to my review. The place smelled odd (maybe humid). I am not sure how to describe the smell. However, somehow, you get used to it. They have dry aged steak (see pics) yummy. Valet parking is available ($6 as of 27JUN24). You must make a reservation before you go. This will ensure you are seated almost as soon  as you arrive. They take walk ins. However,  reservations take priority.",
      "A very cute and old timey classic steakhouse located in Koreatown (Los Angeles)!\n\nFirst off, parking sucks in this part of town and even with valet, the lot was full because it's a very small parking lot. Ended up driving around and finally finding a spot on the streets 10 minutes walk away.\n\nLove the lowlight and classic ambiance of LA past. I ordered an Old Fashioned at the bar, it was not very good. Had some mushed up oranges and maraschino cherries on the bottom, weird but whatever.\n\nWe were seated pretty quickly as we had a reservation and waiting for the rest of the party to show up. They have really cute and comfortable victorian-esque chairs. I ordered a blue filet mignon, it was tasty, but far from blue which I expected to get a rare at best, but it was honestly overcooked rare even. Still tasty though!\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good steakhouse! Maybe their La Canada location might be easier for parking. Would recommend for birthdays and dates!",
      "I really love coming to this place. It's got an old-school vibe to it. I guess that is because it is old-school, it's been there since 1953 and the booths are spectacular. The food is delicious and the best prices you can imagine for the quality of the fare they offer and you can get a good drink from their bars. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is not a vegetarian or vegan or a pescatarian. Oh, and friendly service too.",
      "OUR EXPERIENCE IS QUITE SHOCKING!! Our valet gave us our car without the keys. My husband stopped for gas and was unable to restart the car because the keys were not returned to us. Taylors was completely unhelpful and unapologetic, showing absolutely no care in assisting us. They simply said the valet was a different company. Meanwhile, my husband was stranded in the middle of Hollywood at 12 a.m. I am completely appalled at their lack of concern. We spent over $500, and this is the appreciation we receive? \"Oh sorry, we can't help you.\"\nWe don't live in LA so can't even describe how frightening this experience was. The female manager working never once said she was sorry. So was as cold as ICE. Truly in shock!",
      "Classic Mad Men era steakhouse. The kind of place that makes you WANT to get dolled up for dinner even if you're dining solo but doesn't make you feel out of sorts for showing up in denim and sneakers.\n\nFairly affordable plates considering that it's steak but its so worth the splurge. Generous portions, great flavor, and even better service. Cocktails and desserts are superb, too! My only gripe is how dark it is inside.\n\nI highly recommended the escargot. They are absolutely worth trying at least once."

      "Tasty and beautiful!\n\nThe menu has a great range of items and everything we got was good. The prices are slightly high, but makes sense considering the restaurant is located in a hotel and the interior was gorgeous. Our mom was a huge fan of the stunning dishes and silverware.\n\n* Breakfast Plate Special: 7/10 - pretty basic\n* French Toast: 8/10 - perfect balance of fruits and maple syrup but I didn't receive the ice cream :(\n* Fried Calamari: 9/10 - awesome batter\n* La La Galbi Set: 8/10 - tasty and loved that it comes with rice\n\nI completely forgot to ask for the ice cream with my French Toast which I assume that the servers also forgot to give to me. Also, they give you the menu and offer to get you drinks when you first sit down. Not really given a chance to look at the prices, my sister ordered bottled water not knowing it was a $4.\n\nThere's free underground parking that doesn't require validation which is really appreciated. The servers were really nice, but is expected since there's an 18% service charge included in the bill.\n\nDespite the mishaps, we'll definitely be returning to try their other dishes!",
      "Absolutely ENCHANTED to discover this little hidden gem lounge in Koreatown! Tucked into the unassuming Garden Suite Hotel, this beautiful lounge features floral-oasis inspired decor, and an extensive menu of innovative cocktails and Korean-inspired fusion dishes. We were pleasantly surprised at how well made every dish and cocktail we ordered was, especially the galbi and bulgogi quesadilla dishes, which were definitely some of the BEST we\u2019ve ever had. Definitely make sure to check out one of Koreatown\u2019s best kept secrets for a date or girl\u2019s night out/brunch, and support a well-deserving small Asian owned business!\n\nFeatured here:\n\ud83c\udf2e bulgogi quesadilla\n\ud83c\udf5d seafood cioppino pasta\n\ud83e\udd69 la la galbi\n\ud83c\udf39 beauty and the beast",
      "Had a fun time dining at this beautifully decorated Garden Cafe and Bar in Ktown. I totally love the aesthetics here, and the lovely presentation of their food and drinks. I really enjoyed the flavors of their Kimchi Pasta and Croffle that's topped with fresh fruits! Really like their selection of dishes, from their delectable desserts to their colorful drinks! Perfect spot to visit during brunch and happy hour!",
      "The ambiance is so cute, food was okay, and service  was very poor.  Our waitress Anna L had a bit of an attitude, she rushed us with the menu, she didn\u2019t once came to the table, was not attentive  one bit. Every time we looked back to get her attention she was always on her phone. Sadly to say. It was so irritating. It was super slow. We had asked a few questions about the food we had ordered and she was so ehhhh about it\u2026. Only good service we had was the food runner. Anna needs to do better with her customer service skills! On top of that if you\u2019re going to add gratuity for table of four, have better service .. \u2026\u2026For that we will not we coming back.!!!",
      "Enchant is a beautiful restaurant in the Garden Suite Hotel in the heart of Koreatown! It has amazing, and helpful staff, and a great selection of foods and drinks that have an Asian fusion theme! Great brunch spot to go with your friends or a significant other! You have to try the Kimchi pasta and it pairs very well with the Born to be Beef!"

      "Amazing place with an all vegetarian menu (with vegan options available). The staff is super friendly. The chef Mario offers great customisations. The Caprese pizza is to die for! Everything was delicious- from the salad, to appetizers, to the pizza. Service was quick. Food presentation was great.",
      "This little hole in wall is without a doubt the best in Korea town. The service is excellent, so warm, welcoming and attentive. You can really tell they care here and the food is so delicious. Everything tastes amazing also they have so many good options for my vegan brother.",
      "Located in Koreatown, Olivia pays homage to some Korean flavors while also having some unique delicacies. All the food was really good, despite feeling more on the unhealthy side. Had the fried olives, fried \u201cchicken\u201d, and the Anderson pizza and finished with the olive cake and chocolate tart. Our waiter was so nice and accommodating. Would definitely come back!!",
      "Very nice staff and the food is amazing! Get the crispy Brussel pizza even if you are not vegan. You won't be disappointed!",
      "Fantastic upscale vegan/vegetarian restaurant!! Chef Mario is next level. Allergen friendly. Vibes are awesome for date night or girls night. We love the wine happy hour and the cavatelli pasta is next level.\n\nI\u2019m lactose intolerant AND have soy allergies so the MACADAMIA ricotta is such a blessing. Bring all your vegan/vegetarian friends here for an unforgettable night.\n\nSmall and loving team based out of Koreatown."

      "Excellent Korean food! Most of the dishes are soups. I had brisket with tripe. Cooked to perfection. The dishes tend to have subtle flavor but they have great condiments. My dish was very lite without all the fat in other cuisines. Parking is an issue but there\u2019s valet parking.",
      "This is a mixed review because what I had was pretty good (mixed cold buckwheat noodles) and the steamed king dumplings was also okay. However the bulgogi set and beef rib soup were just average. They have a large menu so perhaps other dishes are better. Parking here is limited and you have to use the valet service which cost $3. There is street parking but it might be a challenge in the evenings.",
      "Lee Ga is a legit Korean food spot. You can come here for both meat and soups. Their menu is pretty good. Service is great. The people are really nice. They helped me cut my cold noodles.\n\nParking was so annoying to find even on a weekday night. They have valet parking for $3. The streets around the area have free parking, but it's really hard to find.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. The side dishes were ok. The kimchi radish on the day I visited was not good though. The kimchi cabbage was better.",
      "Small and amazing. The crowning dish is their kalbi cooked over mushrooms and potatoes so as to not burn the meat on the hot cast iron. Sooooo good. Fresh banchan. Their tangy beef rib soup is to die for and I wish I remembered the name but it hand that pickled veggie that gives it an amazing little funk that I love.",
      "Decent food and appreciate that they don't salt the soup much and let you choose the level of salt and condiments to add to it.\n\nNot sure if we ordered the right items, but in terms of food it's just average.\n\nIf you're nearby and feel like this type of noodle soup go and give it a try. I wouldn't be driving here just to have dinner as we did this evening."

      "This place has great dumplings and fried rice that won't break the bank. Located in a strip mall with an interior that does not have all the bells a whistles. But go with friends, split a Soju, and enjoy.",
      "First time in K town and loved this spot. I got the kimchi dumplings and shrimp fried rice, both came out hot and fresh. Kind service and clean environment. Thanks for the tasty bite!",
      "We had a taste for some authentic dumplings in Koreatown.  After vetting the internet, we chose here and weren't disappointed!\n\nMy order of Fried Rice With Shrimp and Vegetables was amazing. As were the Steamed Dumplings, and both the Short Rib and Beef Dumpling Soups. And I felt generally safe parking there with the roving Security Guards present. Recommended for a delicious meal!",
      "Great little spot. Friendly staff and massive portions. Nice to get a mix. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for some extra chilli sauce.\n\nGood value, would recommend.",
      "Good dumplings, but I was expecting a little more given the hype around this restaurant features on Bourdain\u2019s parts unknown. We got the spicy steam dumplings with pork and shrimp, which are wrapped in dough but not sealed which made the meat taste a little dry. I think I would want to try the boiled dumplings next time. We also got the king steam dumplings with pork and vegetable. The dough was very good, but the filling was a little bland for my taste as there was much more egg & noodle filling than pork\n\nOur favorite part was the free ban chan, really good quick pickled daikon and Kimchi. Also the service was quick and they were very kind and helpful. They do a very nice job. If you like simpler flavorings and food parings this may be better suited to your taste.\n\nIt is located in a strip mall but the parking was full when we got there. We were able to find a space on the side streets. We went at noon on a Friday and were able to be seated right away, but I imagine it would be much more crowded on a weekend."

      "I love the fact that Google Maps integration with OpenTable makes reservations really easy here!  Let me say that the decor here is really interesting!  Reminiscent of 1930s settings, it's kinda' cool!  Their food are really modern and unique, so it really stands out compared to foods in the area, just like their decor does.  So this is a nice place to take your date to.  We were very slow, so I want to thank the staff for being very patient with us.  Then again they did tack on an 18% because we were over 5 people. My friend that sat next me complained that went against SB478, so they might want to update their written menus to display that, and give their future patrons a reminder.  Other thing you may want to be aware of is when you split the bill, they can accept up to 3 cards at most, and it has to be split evenly.  If you need everything itemized and separated into different bills, you need to tell them ahead of time.\n\nAlso, if you take the receipt to Caffe Concerto, you get a 10% off.  Keep in mind when it comes to paying the bill, you need to make sure you let them know ahead of time that the bill should be separated as well.",
      "Great place with super nice, 1950s vibes, and fantastic decor. Special shooutout to Mini, a great bartender that always displays exceptional customer service and has good language skills in her native Korean, English and even a bit of Spanish. The place is open till late, the food is delicious and the drinks are good. Not much else to say!",
      "\u2728I was transported back in time at Seoul Salon, located in the heart of Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown\u2728\n\nWe had: \ud83e\uded3Bulgogi Quesadilla (tortilla, cheese, beef bulgogi), \ud83e\udd80Crab Meat Seafood Cream Pasta (crab meat, mussels, shrimp, clams, squid, red onion, heavy cream), \ud83c\udf36\ufe0fSpicy Rice Cake Tteokbokki (rice cake, fish cake, cabbage, egg, Korean spicy paste), \ud83e\udd90Gambas (marinated shrimp, olive oil, lemon, bread), \ud83c\udf62Skewers (pork belly and sausages/rice cake), \ud83c\udf57Garlic Popcorn KFC (fried chicken and French fries), \ud83c\udf5fTruffle French Fries, \ud83c\udf53Strawberry Soju (fresh strawberries, soju, lime juice, lemon juice, simple syrup)",
      "a tavern themed Korean restaurant that has some really excellent crafted drinks you should try. I recommend the yuzu mojito and the miss Korea. They also specialize in Korean Italian fusion dishes like their variety of pastas. I got their crab and seafood pasta and omg it was SO garlicky. Every bite was full of flavor and the pasta was al dente. Their yuzu brisket salad was also tasty and interesting but I would put the dressing on the side. I also got their oven roasted pork belly which I thought fell short. The pork wasn\u2019t too tender and lacked flavor without the soy sauce it would have been too bland. Let me know what you guys think!",
      "Just came for drinks! 20 oz Watermelon soju was super refreshing. Yuzu mojito during happy hour was also delicious! Red dot was great too."

      "Us: got the cheese chicken (regular is regular spicy that you can enjoy even you aren't fan of spicy food) and the pasta. Pasta is very good!\n\nOthers: the price is a bit out there but worth giving them a solid shot.\n\nOwner: has two ppl wait our table and they were very professional",
      "The most delicious place among Cajun Seafood.\nOther menu items such as pasta, chicken wings, etc. are also delicious, so I would like to recommend this place..",
      "Great food in a casual cozy atmosphere.  First off, you can't beat $1 oysters, served during happy hour. The oysters are chef's choice and on the day we went, we had Blue Points.  They were fresh and delicious - so delicious that we ordered another 3 dozen for the 4 of us!  The garlic noodles with shrimp were great.  We also had the happy hour pitcher plus chicken wings for 19.99 - loved the chicken wings!  The uni pasta was a bit whatever for me - I've had better versions.  My fave of the night was the spicy fire chicken (bool dak) served on top of tater tots and oozy melty cheese!  We got a combo of regular spicy and hot, and omg it was so hot, but the flavors were so good, I couldn't stop eating it!  Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu offerings",
      "My boyfriend super loved what he got - the spicy chicken on tater tots with cheese, so he would've rated it as 5*, but my shrimp pasta wasn't that great, which would've garnered 3*, so we will average it at 4.\n\nMy pasta sauce was supposed to be a ros\u00e9, but was more tomatoey and not creamy at all. In fact, it was really sour and salty, so a proper ros\u00e9 with the cream would have really balanced out those flavors.\n\nMy friend super highly recommended this place, so I would probably come try again but order something that is more pub food oriented, since this is a gastropub. Their uni cream pasta is one of their most popular dishes, so maybe I should have tried that instead, since I was interested in that too. Next time!",
      "Great place with an awesome menu. The fried squid was really crispy and pretty fresh but they should season the batter or at least after they fry it. Very tasteless and only served with regular mayonaise. The honey nutty butter chicken was incredible though. Will come back to try their other chicken dishes."

      "Amazing! Highly recommend the jokbal or pork trotters (feet)! Got the lunch combo available from 11-3 i think which is just under $20.  I typically don't eat a lot of pork but wow they seasoned it so well,  it tasted the best compared to the bossam. Tofu soup was also very delicious with the jokbal! Great banchan. Beef bulgogi was also very good/tasty!! And i normally don't like bulgogi. Parking can be tough.  Street or tiny parking lot.",
      "Loved the food here!\nBest bo ssam pork belly I've had. Loved it with the radish. Cabbage was cut a little thick but taste was great.\nChive pancake was also a major win. Super crispy and flavorful.\n\nHighly recommend checking out this new place!",
      "I don't understand the negative reviews, what a bunch of sour Karen's with obviously no taste in authentic good food and portions.(FYI the food photo taken after we started eating it and taken a few pieces, it was present beautifully before this photo and had more) . I went here today with my bf and the food was amazing and authentic as it gets. I've been to Seoul, South Korea myself and I had one of the best foods recommended there and this place is on par with those I've had there. Korean food is one of my favorites and this place does it perfectly. I had the pork soup and bossam to share, the broth was so good and delicious, portions were nice. The kimchi here is truly one of the best kimchi's I've ever had, just perfectly balanced in every way. Honestly, I have had a hard time finding good food here in L.A but on our last day here we are so happy we found this hidden gem.",
      "*****PLEASE READ\n\nWhile my daughter and I were eating, we found multiple pieces of silica gel in our radish side dish. We bit into around four total. The first few times we thought we had chipped a tooth or it was some kind of spice/seasoning. We ate with caution. The third and fourth time it happened, we spit it out and took pictures. When I fished around in the side dish container, I found one more fully intact.\n\nWhen we called in hopes of figuring out what was going on, we were met with a rude, dismissive woman. Not a single word even close to \"sorry\" was said and she told us that next time we come she'd give us a free tray of soondae. When I said that the free tray of soondae wasn't the focus and that I wanted to know if this was some kind of mistake, she got annoyed that I was angry and told me it was probably just a piece of plastic. I get that silica gel is non-toxic but how is this okay? And if its \"just a piece of plastic\" is it any better? She treated us like we called to complain for some free food and talked to us with insane attitude.\n\nI was excited to try the food as it was a new place in the nighborhood. Never going back there again. I understand mistakes can happen as it's very easy to mess things up in the food industry but the attitude and words I was met with was unbelievable."

      "I would give 4.5 overall. I had to try this place when I saw their shrimp dumpling picture on Whilshire as I could eat dumplings every day. I personally liked fried dumplings better over steamed. Not sure if it was just that day, but their kimchi dumpling was a bit too spicy. Their kimbap was not bad but wasn't two thumbs up."

      "Was looking for a late night eat, they close at 4am so convenient. Soups & banchan were delicious. Small place but accommodating.",
      "We came here for the dinner after a show. Such a nice and clean place. The waitress was super sweet and friendly. Took care of us all the time. The menu is great. Easy to make the decisions. We had the tofu soup with pork and also the spicy beef soup. Both very good. Highly recommend the tofu soup. Silky and full flavoured. Just wish the portion of banchans was a little more. Definitely come back again!",
      "The wait was ridiculous for the food. They lacked one staff member but should have more than the staff they had on hand anyway. I think the highlight was the Japchae Noodle dish. The Banchan was okay and the soon soup was also okay. Not a fan but not the worst experience either."

      "One of the best surprises we have had in a while this restaurant really delivered in all levels. Great vibe, good service, and really unique and tasty food. We tried several things and the only thing that didn\u2019t work for us was the stuffed chicken wings, we were not a fan of the chewy skin. Unfortunately that was the only dish we remembered to photo. Definitely a must-return.",
      "Nestled discreetly in a modest strip mall, this Japanese gem in K-town features a modern, low-lit ambiance with minimalist aesthetic. Light gray walls and dark wood tables adorned with petite lamps create a cool, comfortable vibe. Behind the scenes, culinary maestros with Michelin accolades orchestrate a menu blending Japanese and Korean influences, offering small plates and standout mains. While slightly on the pricier side, the proportions and consistent high quality impress. The crudo, scallop, corn and duck breast emerge as the bench borderline star performers on the menu but let's cut to the chase \u2013 the pork katsu steals the show. This main dish is not just great; it's the undisputed superstar of the menu. Reservations are needed as the space is intimate but does not feel cramped once seated. Hibi is a standout destination and proves that good dining can be found in unassuming places.",
      "I\u2019m usually the one to gate keep my favorite restaurants but this place is so good that the people deserve to know!!\n\nThe service, the food, the ambiance.. a perfect blend of things to make this experience one of the best in LA. All ingredients sourced locally and the lengths this restaurant goes to romance each ingredient right in front of you had me in a choke hold.\n\nGet the bara uni toast\u2026 thank me later lol",
      "Good experience. Each dish was well prepared. Good date restaurant.",
      "Thank you for the delicious meal, every dish was full of flavor and freshness. So glad to have been able to sit in right away, you will have lines out of your door very soon."

      "Got to come here for the first time! Had a spicy one and rose based one with some deep fries!\n\nThought we ordered the vegetarian one but rose one came with pork in. But they kindly replaced it with one without.\n\nHonestly, I like the spicy one better with deep fries!",
      "I finally tried this place after seeing photos and videos on social media and it did not disappoint! Their menu consists of a variety of Korean street food and I wasn't sure what to try but the staff recommended her favs, JAWS COMBO and GIMBAP.\n\nThe JAWS COMBO came with your choice of spicy rice cakes soup or topokki with 3 sides: fried chicken strips, fried seaweed rolls and fried dumplings. Huge portion and 4 people could easily share it. The topokki soup is loaded with soft and chewy rice cakes, fish cakes, cheese and other stuff. It was spicy ,slightly sweet and I was told you're supposed to dip the fried food in it and gosh, it was sooo good!\n\nI tired the SHRIMP GIMBAP and surprised how big it was. Packed with veggies, shrimp and very little rice. It was really good too. I also got the SOONDAE or blood sausage for my mom because it's her favorite and she liked it a lot!\n\nService was great, the interior was bright and inviting. Will definitely be back whenever I visit LA.\n\nNOTE: Parking is limited since it's located inside a small business plaza but there's also street parking.",
      "It's the best kimbap I've had in LA. You must dip it in the Topokki sauce for the full experience. The half-size Topbokki is great for trying various menu items. I'll definitely be back for more!",
      "New! Just opened on 11/27.\n\nReview 11/28: overall 4 stars\nGot a takeout of just their chicken strip. Has a salty, onion flavor with a good crunch. Decent portion for the price. But it doesn\u2019t come with any sauce or side dishes. Sauce is extra cost. We paid for ours but it was left out from our takeout order.\nService was nice but they just opened so they\u2019re still trying to figure things out so it can be slow when placing orders.\nOpen space with causal dining in option.\nParking can be a pain but there\u2019s valet or street parking option. Takeout is free parking for limited time.\n\nWill update review when I try their other dishes.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nUpdated review 12/09:\nWent back today to get their Jaws combo and basic gimbap. Overall 2.5 stars\n\nTteokbokki: WAY TOO SPICY. Has good toppings like quail egg, fish cake and glass noodles but I had such bad stomach pain from the spice and going to the restroom was hell \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca9. They didn\u2019t offer options to make it less spicy. The taste was okay\u2026\nChicken strips: dry and hard\nMandu: soggy and flavorless\nKimmari: crunchy and delicious\nKimbap: big and good but way overpriced\n\nJaws combo was around $30+ and the basic kimbap was $8+. I think both were too pricy for being fast food. The food is ready within 5-10 minutes as most are pre-made.\n\nI would come to the the other dishes but wound not get the teokkboki again as it was just pure pain. Staff was still nice but they were still working on being trained.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6cc\uc11c \uae30\uc808\ud558\ub294\uc904\uc54c\uc557\uc5b4\uc694\n\ub9db\uc740 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \ub9db\uc788\uc9c0\ub294\uc548\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad1c\ucc2c\uace0, \uac00\uaca9\uc740 \ubd84\uc2dd\uc74c\uc2dd\uce58\uace0\ub294 \uc2f8\uc9c0\ub294\uc544\ub294\uac70\uac19\uc544\uc694\n\uc77c\ud558\uc2dc\ub294\ubd84\ub4e4\uc740 \uce5c\uc808\ud574\uc694",
      "Got the Jaws topokki, regular spice. I only ate half the platter but I was crying by the end (not good with spicy food ._.) Get the mild spice or other less-spicy option if you're not a glutton for spice. Would rate the taste 8.5/10 with very good portion size.\n\nAlso, very clean dining area and restroom."

      "I loved this place! We took a chance and tried a new restaurant and we absolutely enjoyed it! I ordered the pork belly with green onions. I ate everything! The green onions are thinly sliced and tossed in a sweet soy type sauce and the pork was super tender. My bf got spicy pork with kimchi and the portion was nice!! The flavor of the food here is definitely worth the price. Wish we could have gotten more water before the end of our meal though haha we were downing it!!",
      "Had it at midnight and it was ok back then, we order the squid and rice cake then in the morning I started having symptoms of diarrheal, and had to buy medicines for that. Wouldn\u2019t  recommend",
      "JJAN exceeded all my expectations! My friends and I decided to give this place a try, and we were blown away by the amazing flavors and cozy atmosphere. I couldn't resist ordering the spicy chicken wings, pork belly with green onions and let me tell you, they were finger-licking good! The perfect balance of heat and flavor had me craving more with every bite. My friend opted for the beef bulgogi, and it was a hit! The tender beef combined with fresh vegetables and perfectly cooked rice made for a satisfying and delicious meal. We were constantly asking for refills! Overall, JJAN is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Korean cuisine with a modern twist. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",
      "Amazing food amazing place and location. Nathan was our waiter he was very nice and welcoming. definitely recommend this place and will be coming back here.",
      "Really awesome vibe and a chill spot. Everything we ordered was tasty. If you get anything doused in cheese you should prob come with at least three people so you can down it fast before the cheese cools down. The chicken and pork were so tender and the flavors were perfect and felt light even though it looked so heavy. I just wish their stools were comfier since my butt was killing me after an hour but that could be exasperated by me being pregnant. Would definitely come again."

      "Chi Chi in Koreatown, Los Angeles, is an incredibly fun spot that offers an authentic Korean dining experience. The food is outstanding, with highlights like the bulgogi sliders and ramen that are simply amazing. Ordering is done through a device that also lets you play games with your group of friends or against everyone in the restaurant. The device includes a live game chat feature, so you can interact with others while you play. Winning coins from the games can be used to purchase food and alcoholic beverages, adding an extra layer of fun. The atmosphere is vibrant and energetic, making it the perfect place to visit with a large group. Highly recommended!",
      "One of the best hang out spot in ktown!\nCame in right after an early dinner with a few friends, the place was chill and only had a few tables but after an hour the whole spot was crowded and there were lines. Food and vibe was definitely on point, love the different food options and food came out fast and with great service.\nDefinitely have to go with the bois or friend groups!",
      "If you plan to dine at Chi Chi LA, remember this: Reservation is a must! This place gets incredibly busy on weekends, and it's no wonder why. Chi Chi LA is a restaurant like no other, offering an extraordinary blend of dining and entertainment.\n\nThe atmosphere on a weekend night is positively vibrant and bustling. The reason? Well, it's all thanks to the special feature at every table \u2013 the personal ordering devices. These nifty gadgets aren't just for placing your food orders; they're a gateway to a world of fun and games.\n\nEach table has its own ordering device, which not only allows you to select your dishes but also provides a variety of interactive games. You can enjoy mini-games by yourself or challenge other tables. There are even spontaneous group challenges initiated by the restaurant. Plus, there's a chat room where you can strike up conversations with diners at other tables.\n\nNow, onto the food. Chi Chi LA offers a tasty menu, though portions are on the smaller side. The flavors are delightful, and I highly recommend trying their flavored Soju cocktails. They come with eye-catching glowing lights and adorable duck decorations that add a cute touch to your dining experience.\n\nThe only drawback is that engaging in conversation can be a bit challenging due to the continuous sounds of excitement from people playing games all around you. But if you're here for a fun and interactive dining adventure, this might not bother you too much.",
      "The manager is really nice, he kept coming to play games with us. The food comes out really quickly too.\n\nBUT ABSOLUTELY DO NOT VALET HERE. The valet is \u201csupposed to be\u201d only $4 and then when we came out they gaslit us and bullied us to pay $20. Making up excuses. They are definitely greedy and relying on people being drunk to agree\n\nSo sad that they ruined our experience because my group honestly liked the place.",
      "\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc14Great Korean bar in Koreatown LA!\nThere was also a self-order menu, so it was very convenient. The free drinks game was actually a great idea! Second floor had outdoor patio and it was very spacious. Great service with lots of fun people. It\u2019s fun to watch people too.\n\n** I'm an emoji Google local guide in DFW areas if you want more reviews, don't forget to follow my account. \ud83d\ude0a  **"

Fried squids were so little.  tukbokki  was\nsweet.  No veggies.  Street food that's overcharged.  I wouldn't recommend.",
      "!!TAKE OUT ONLY BEWARE!!\nOrdered two spicy Kimbap (spicy pork and spicy squid), spicy tteokboki, udon soup. Food was good, but the level of spice was TOO MUCH. if you\u2019re white, STAY AWAY. I have a high spice tolerance, but both spicy kimbap were way spicier than expected. The tteokboki for sure recommend!! But not combined with the kimbap. Individually, all dishes were good but together the spice was too much to bear. Udon soup is good, but has a lot of fish cake and only two shrimps.",
      "The Kimbap is amazing!\n\nThis is my new favorite Korean restaurant. Taste = authentic, ingredients were quality, portions are solid,  great options and awareness of vegetarian/vegan diets, fast turnaround time. It's take out only, which we didn't know as we just stumbled across it, but the packaging made it convenient.\n\nCan't wait to go again next time in LA."

One of Their signature dish, a big bowl of delicious components: chewy rice cakes, tender fish cakes, and crunchy cabbage, all topped with a generous layer of gooey mozzarella cheese that adds a creamy counterbalance to the heat. is a fiery delight that will satisfy any heat seeker. The noodles are perfectly cooked, soaking up the rich, spicy sauce that's packed with flavor.\n\nEnhance your meal with add-ons like savory sausages, plump dumplings, and crispy fried spam, which provide even more texture and taste. Each element blends harmoniously, creating a deeply satisfying and memorable culinary experience.\n\nThe restaurant's vibrant atmosphere and friendly service further enhance the dining experience, making YUP DDUK an excellent choice for those craving a bold and hearty meal.",

The rice balls are needed, trust me.",
      "I love this place. There is nothing not to like except how small the restaurant is. It is very small and very popular so the wait can get long, especially during dinner hours and the lot can become packed with cars so parking is a nightmare.\n\nBeware of spice. My boyfriend and I shared an extra mild and for me it's good. There was sweetness with a little tang. there is no \"no spicy\"\noptions so anyone who cannot tolerate an ounce of spice is out of luck.\n\nThe options are endless for what you can add-in.  My boyfriend loved their blood sausage, I love the texture but the irony flavor is not for me but he did claim to be the BEST sausage he probably has ever had in his life so I am sure it meant something.\n\nService is top class. they accidentally placed the neighboring table order on ours for 2 seconds and then gave us free yogurt as an apology. No one was angry but we appreciated the drink!"

      "Houston\u2019s is a great upscale dining experience. They have really good food and excellent quality. The tuna was amazing with fresh vegetables. I honestly wasn\u2019t impressed with the French dip sandwich, but maybe it\u2019s a different style. It has USDA prime roast, but it was cold and felt basically under cooked. Everything else I\u2019ve had was amazing and it\u2019s a beautiful restaurant.",
      "This used to be an excellent steakhouse but for various reasons no longer deserves my patronage.\n\nFirst off - there is absolutely no parking. Not in the adjacent lot, not in the lot on the other side and also not in the 4 story lot across the street.  They must offer valet, or diners like me will miss their reservation time as I did. 20 minutes to find parking is ridiculous.\n\nThe menu is extremely limited, and lacks many basic commonplace items like Cobb salad, soup, no ribeye steak (only one sized 10 oz fillet), limited side dishes, and limited deserts (no sorbet, no berries...).\n\nThe server got our order wrong 3 times. Kitchen fault. Sent her with a pork chop instead of salmon. Missed my rice and black beans until so so so much later than my main dish (fillet) was served, that it missed my entire meal.\n\nThe \"traditional salad\", the French fries and the spicy tuna rolls were all very average. My fillet was excellent (medium) but lacked flavoring. No asparagus, no baked potato, just broccoli (which was excellent).\n\nAbsolutely not going back there. For a long time."

      "Excellent food! This is one of my friend's most treasured spots that she shared with me!  We went there for her birthday, and her staple favorite is spaghetti and meatballs! It was actually quite good as the sauce absolutely made the dish! We went there at 10:00 p.m. for a great dinner on a Friday night, and even at this hour it was super busy!\nDefinitely recommend reservations! Very busy, the outdoor seating gives a bit of a less cramped feel. Seating was comfortable and our table definitely accommodated our orders. Their drink menu is pretty vast (I did not order any alcoholic beverages, but my friend absolutely loves wine and had her pick of her favorites).\nOur server was absolutely amazing! Great attitude, knew the menu in and out, readily would make recommendations if asked, but not pushy at all!\nWe will definitely be going back for our friend dates!",
      "This place gets packed!  Make reservations because you\u2019ll want to go here. The food is very good and the service equally good. The setting is slightly upscale casual so you\u2019ll see a wide audience, but clearly everyone is enjoying the company, the food, and the time. I don\u2019t live here but will definitely come back next time I\u2019m in town. For appetizers we got the crispy eggplant Parmesan (so so good) and crispy calamari. For meals, 3 of us ordered the bolognese while one had the spicy rigatoni vodka, which absolutely rocked. For me, that\u2019s a go to dish. Definitely must try this place.",
      "Really good food and service. They even ran someone out to tell us the food was coming in a couple of minutes, though I didn't think it was taking long at all. It's pretty choke though, even on a weekday night so get that reservation in.",
      "Great meal at North Italia.  The truffle bread as a starter was divine!  My bolognese with pappardelle noodles was so good.  Everything was seasoned so well!  It can get noisy on the inside, but they have a really nice outdoor seating area and that was perfect for a relaxing dinner!  Service was efficient and pleasant!!!  Would definitely return!",
      "We went for an after graduation celebration last Friday.  Food is great and service is excellent.  We sat at the patio which is nice and cool.  We love the experience and we will be back."

Bar looks great and is full stocked. Restrooms are clean and befitting of the atmosphere of the restaurant. The service is above-and-beyond, give Carlos a raise.

Whether you\u2019re a fan of Cuban food or simply looking to try something new, Habana Restaurant is a must-visit. The combination of delicious food, vibrant atmosphere, and excellent service makes it a gem in Irvine\u2019s dining scene.",
      "We came here to celebrate a birthday. They have both indoor and semi-outdoor seating which is very nice on a sunny day. We ordered a few appetizers like Ceviche Tropical and Avocado Frito. For entries, we ordered Paella, Lechon Asado, El Churrasco and Rum Pepper Shrimp. Everything was delicious and we finished all plates lol.",
      "Mixed bag here. Food was mostly okay but for the prices should have been way better. Staff was friendly but not overly attentive. The Mac and cheese we had as a side was the only thing to write home about."

      "Wonderful food, service and atmosphere.  Had an event here many years ago and locked down the whole location. Staff, service food was perfect.  Price was spot on too for what you get.\n\nJust came again lately and had to remind myself to come here more often, it's in the corporate area so you forget, but it's only a few miles away from the residential areas.\n\nFood was still great as well as service.  The venue is just so nice with the amount of windows, it really does remind you hints of Italy.  Made me want to go back to Florence."

      "I celebrated my birthday at Solstice Restaurant in Irvine, Orange County, and it was an incredible experience. From the moment we arrived, the service was exceptional. The cocktail, appetizers were delicious and set the tone for an amazing meal. Every dish we tried was expertly prepared and bursting with flavor. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable celebration. I highly recommend Solstice Restaurant for any occasion!",
      "I've been here a few times for dinner, and the dishes we ordered are always on point. Flavorful but not salty. This time I came in for lunch and most dishes were salty to overly salty. We had to send it back to the kitchen to remake it. It tasted better second time around but still not comparable to dinner. Still enjoyed our food as our waiter made a big difference with our dinning experience. Customer service is definitely top notch.",
      "Very modern restaurant  inside office complex.  Definitely  a place for work lunch and after work happy hour, even if happy hours ends at 5:30pm.  Server was extremely  knowledgeable  friendly  and fast.  Food was good well presented.  Fresh seasonal  ingredients.  We were there to celebrate two birthdays  and they got recognized  with 2 free desserts  and glass of white bubbly wine for everyone  at the table. Nice gesture.",
      "I\u2019ve been here twice. It\u2019s sweet that they give a hand signed card by staff and dessert for special occasions. I enjoy the idea of the seasonal menu. The food and drinks are different and creative, but okay. The flavors are missing something. Cool place, but I wouldn\u2019t come back. Fun to try.",
      "We came here on a recommendation of a friend to celebrate a birthday, and it did not disappoint! The service was amazing. Honestly some of the kindest, most attentive staff I\u2019ve ever experienced at a restaurant, and they even wrote a personalized birthday card! All of our drinks were 10/10 (highly recommend the lavender lemon drop) and the ambiance was so light and bright! The food was mostly amazing as well, though I probably would not order the lobster gnocchi again. Very much enjoyed the rolls, tuna tartare, short rib, burger, crab cakes, and butter cake though! And they brought out a round of champagne for a birthday toast which was very thoughtful. Overall would gladly come back! And though we missed happy hour, it looked like a great time as well"

      "Extremely nice meal!! Knock on the service because they brought the wrong knife out for the chops.\nExcellent wine list, great wine by the glass selection.\nThere is a live band playing most nights and it is very nice. There is artwork for sale at each station again really a nice touch for local artists.\n\nA vast selection on the menu. But get your dessert souffl\u00e9 in early!!! Totally worth it.\n\nI will definitely go back here!",
      "Delicious food! The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare! Not many places get the right temperature for food. The 16oz Rib Eye comes with one side of potatoes, we added one mo re side and it was enough for two people! Previously we had had the wedge salad as an appetizer which I did not take a picture off but it was delicious too. We went on a Saturday night and they had live music, very nice location. Service was very flat and we had to wait a long time to have our order taken but it\u2019s definitely a place I would go back for the great food. Parking it\u2019s $8 an hour but they validate your ticket at the end which I was not expecting but was very nice.",
      "Great live music here - I have discovered a few favorite bands here. The menu here is perfection. They are great with preparing lamb, chicken and salmon, but everything here is really delicious. Great cocktails and very friendly and professional staff (with great memories).",
      "We had a party of 9 dine here for lunch which all but one was trying it for the very first time. The restaurant dining area was beautiful! It was decorated beautifully for the Christmas holiday. Our server Eddie was awesome, he tended to our entire table and helped those of us unsure about what to order. My wife ordered a Caesar salad with salmon, and I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. The food was delicious! The restaurant hit all the right points (food*service*ambiance)! There were no leftovers to take home, at least from our orders. It was a great time! Eddie was also just as good a photographer as he was a server. He took several photos of our group, from all angles of the table. Coffee was good, restrooms were clean, food was reasonably priced for the quality, and their parking was plenty. We had no negatives to report. We look forward to dining here again whenever we're in the Irvine area again.",
      "We had the most wonderful experience. The entire staff were very generous with their time and their smiles. Our server, Eddie, was attentive and well acquainted with the menu and bar. He helped guide us through our meal and drink selections and was the perfect gentleman.\n\nWe started with the tuna tartare, my dinner was the fettuccine pasta, my other half enjoyed the king salmon, dessert was the pumpkin cheesecake. All of it was divine. We particularly enjoyed the appetizer and dessert.\n\nOverall, we felt very welcome and hope to be back again soon."

      "Go for the \u201csandwiches\u201d. The menu seems to skew towards chicken which is weird but I hear poultry is popular these days. The decor was good but could be dated in a few years. It just seemed like the patio is place to be rather than inside.\n\nThe shaved pork chop sandwich was possibly one of the best burgers I\u2019ve had in years. It had the perfect balance of heat, savory and rich tang from the bbq. And the fries were just about perfect.\n\nOnly downside was the fried chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry. They can change that but it wasn\u2019t very memorable. There\u2019s probably a better sandwich to try.",
      "Overall, all the foods I tried were quite unique and flavorful. My personal top #1 is portobello mushroom fries. They come little moist, not crispy crispy but the batter itself adds really good flavor to the mushrooms and the sauce as well. The other menus were alright, little salty for regular meal but probably better with alcohol drinks.",
      "The first time I dined here. I was here for the team lunch. Enjoyed the foods and ambience. The Gulf Shrimp & Grits I ordered was amazing as well as the appetizers we ordered. The server was great. I would like to come back for dinner next time.",
      "We made a reservation at 5:45, arrived at 5:40 and were seated immediately.\n\nAfter a few minutes our waiter came over and took drink orders. Then we didn\u2019t see him again for a while. We placed our food orders and it took a bit to get food. I ordered the sugar barrel steak and did not get a steak knife until I was half way through my meal. Our waiter was friendly, but was seldomly seen.\n\nThe steak was amazing! Perfect crunch, the flavor was perfect. The potatoes and green beans were a perfect compliment.\n\nI ordered the chocolate bourbon buttermilk bar, it had a weird flavor and was not as sweet as I expected.",
      "Came for brunch the other day and really enjoyed the food. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Love the area and the atmosphere. We brought our toddler who loved the grassy area outside to run around. Service was pretty slow and our waitress kept forgetting things so that was a bummer. Wish they had a kids menu and more nonalcoholic drinks like fancy coffees..."

      "Aria is a relatively new comer though it is not the first restaurant operated and owned by the family. Caspian, Irvine Grill and now closed Super Irvine are other establishments belonging to the family.\nThis is one of its own kind though. The menu is Persian/Mexican fusion. It is located on Jamboree, parking might be struggle depending on the day and time. The decor is very modern and nothing has been spared. The colors, the settings are very charming. The booth tables are small and getting in and out of the booth is a challenge due to its narrow setting. Warm chips with salsa is offered at the beginning and if you ask they refill the chips. Both were very good.\nThe staff is attentive and service is quick.\nWe ordered a combination of Persian and Mexican dishes and they were all good and generous in size.\nThe price is ok for the kind of level they are trying to reach out.\nNothing was impressive with desserts and definitely can benefit from an uplift.\nOvertime, I hope they can improve their shortcomings but overall we are very pleased with our dining experience at Aria and wish them best luck.\nAlso to note almost everything is halal in this restaurant.",

The vibe is perfect for a relaxing evening out.\n\nThe wine selection is impressive, offering a variety of exquisite options that pair beautifully with the dishes. I highly recommend the short ribs pasta, which was cooked to perfection and incredibly flavorful. Another standout dish was the fennel sausages pizza, a delightful combination of textures and tastes that left a lasting impression.\nHow ever the chicken plate and stuffed squash were amazing too.\nAbout Burrata, I expected little bit more of cheese and tomato (bigger portion) however it was delicious.",
      "A great spot aesthetically speaking. The grilled octopus was great and the sauce was perfect, light, and just Italian. Loved the marinated beans too. The squid ink linguine was delicious. It was perfection from the sauce to the flavors to the clam. The red wine braised short rib mafaldine pasta was also incredible. I would have liked a little more sauce to stick to the pasta, but otherwise everything was well flavored and the textures were on point. We sat outside and the heaters were on and the seats were well cushioned.",
      "People give this place 5 stars must not know what clean plates and silverware look like.\nI\u2019ve noticed things are floating in their water they bring (bottom itself isn\u2019t clean either).\nSo we ordered bottled water. Silverware had streaks of people\u2019s lip mark\u2026. Gross \ud83e\udd2e\nThen desert chocolate pudding\u2019s glass cup had lip mark and other dusts (look at the picture I posted).\n\nIt\u2019s sad cuz their food isn\u2019t half bad but it makes me wonder if they know how to do dish well or they are not into sanitizing serving dishes. Do they even clean pots and pans????\n\nOur Server was assigned large space and we only saw him to take order and bringing order. We had to sneak in our dessert order when he came to ask us if we need box for leftover. He could\u2019ve gotten 25% tip if he had more time to ask what we needed but 15% was even too much for what he did. I don\u2019t blame him really but management need to figure it out cuz there are many Italian restaurant in the mall.",
      "This large Italian eatery is located in Spectrum Mall in Irvine directly across from Starbucks. We tried several dishes and couple of pizzas and several desserts. Result was mostly great dishes and a few misses. Meatball appetizer is quite good as it comes with tasty polenta sauce. Squid ink linguini in tomato clam sauce was very well done. Short rib pasta was fine but they give you only a bits of shredded rib meat rather than the entire rib. We had Pepperoni and Pineapple pizzas. Both were delicious and their pizza crust was crispy and chewy. Pistachio gelato ordered had no distinctive taste of pistachios. Not sure what it was. Service could have been more attentive and friendly. They have both indoor and outdoor tables. Parking is available in the large parking structures around the mall.",
      "The food was better than I expected - the two of us got pastas and they both had very flavorful sauces. The server was nice and attentive, but she tricked us into getting some bread. We told her we didn\u2019t want any appetizers or cocktails and then she asked if we wanted bread, and said yes assuming it was complimentary, but it came out to be $8.\n\nI enjoyed the meal and the bread, but I really don\u2019t like any surprises on a bill."

Not too oily nor salty. They give LOTS of meat. I had over 9 pcs of meat inside my bowl.\n\nI have to come back when I hungrier! They have lots of options. Lots of shaved ice too!\nParking: it\u2019s in a plaza so there\u2019s lots of parking!\n\nPrice: reasonable with the big portions.\n\nUpdate:\nTried their shaved ice multiple times before posting this review. Must get!! It\u2019s summer so it\u2019s a good spot. I\u2019m sure they can get it to go but it\u2019s so much prettier as well as yummier there.\n\nPopcorn chicken: very dry and isn\u2019t as much as I\u2019d expect. Portion wise for this was a bit less than I\u2019d expect. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get this again.",
      "Food was too good. Hooked on first bite. Best popcorn chicken I had in Socal. Very minimal flour was used. All chicken meat used. Not blended with fat or tendons. This is going to be my weekly spot for sure. Dog friendly! Their dog beef bowl was so good, fresh and hot. My dog and I loved it lol. (I tried a bite). Highly recommend this place. Reasonably priced. Plenty seating outside also.",
      "Me and my husband came here around 7-8 pm on a Wednesday and it wasn\u2019t too packed. But the food was great! We will definitely be back for some bingsoo next time! I got the beef soup and it was delicious. We LOVED the sweet potato fries as well."

Steak in the salad was perfect and everything was fresh and delicious. We spent like 30 dollars each and had a perfect time there. Service was fast and friendly.",
      "Food was awesome unfortunately the service was super slow.  We were in this place nearly 3 hrs.  Most of the time I had to get up and hunt down a waiter to take our order.   Too bad, wished I had a better experience.  When you pay $300+  for a dinner for 4,  before tips you expect a better experience.",
      "The Steakhouse Salad is a Keto masterpiece! The steak was grilled to perfection. The bacon, avocado and blend of cheeses added to the protein in an explosion of compliments. The Lemon Horseradish dressing is the perfect selection and Deviled Eggs to boot? Best salad I\u2019ve had, maybe ever!\nSpecial shout out to Brian and Zach for superb service. I will be back!!",
      "Kitchen is open to the restaurant so you hear everything going on. For an up scale steak house one would think that would not be a thing. We saw the server twice/ order taker. We saw the food delivery/server three times.  Load baked potato was not very loaded. Steak was amazing.",
      "We truly enjoyed everything about this restaurant from the decor to the food!!  And the service was spot on, they never left us needing anything, they were on top of it!   Highly recommend!"

The service is consistent and the menu is varied and dependable.\n\nLast night we were served by Mitch (think I'm remembering that correctly) and he was great.\n\nMy ahi salad was good but maybe a tad overdressed and underseasoned (the greens themselves, not the ahi).\n\nThe edamame is SO GOOD.\n\nThe club sandwich is always a hit and the fries are awesome--so crispy.\n\nWe also got the brownie dessert and it was delicious--gooey and crunchy on the edges.\n\nAnd obviously--I love the dog friendly theme of the restaurant.",
      "Had been a bit since I had been in a lazy dog and this location did not disappoint. We had the calamari and wings to start. Wings were my favorite of the night. Calamari is not fried and crunchy a typical, but still delicious!! The bison burger was ok. Fries were bomb! Leave room for the butter cake \ud83e\udd24",

I\u2019ve had their bowls, their burgers, several of their apps and salads. I\u2019ve never had a bad meal at any of the Lazy Dog locations and the service is always good.\n\nHowever, the dish that takes the cake is their Chips and Queso. I have NEVER been a Queso guy but this stuff is AMAZING.  I really wish there was a LD near where I live.\n\nI\u2019ve searched online a number of times and can\u2019t find the recipe."

      "We came in for lunch today for the first time.  The food was alright, and we enjoyed the King Salmon sushi, and the toro was nice. However, the Gyu Don was so-so, and the miso soup smelled really strongly of some unfiltered water/ sanitary cleaning water. We just have some questions why regular shrimp or tako(octopus) sushi is not sold here, when it is most usually sold in most sushi places. Overall, the biggest complaint we have is the tip calculations are based on tax, when another reciept\u2019s calculation is off of the usual bill, making it really obvious that there is something wrong with the POS.  Even if this may be a small thing, it is major in a customer\u2019s perspective. I advise the manager to fix this problem.",
      "Izakaya Osen quickly became my favorite Japanese spot in Irvine. They have convenient free parking nearby, which is a plus! The menu offers a huge variety: sushi, hot pot, skewers, bowls, noodles - and everything I've tried has been super fresh and high-quality.\n\nDon't miss their unique sushi with uni, sweet shrimp, caviar, and truffle, or the decadent toro, uni, and caviar option. These are incredible! The miso crab salmon and unagi hot pot are must-tries as well. The servers are friendly and attentive, and the food arrives fast.\n\nOverall, Izakaya Osen is a must-visit for anyone looking for a delicious Japanese dining experience in Irvine. The fresh ingredients, extensive menu, and excellent service make it a hidden gem!",
      "Made reservations for a Monday lunch date with my husband.  I do eat quite a bit of sushi and omakase so I\u2019m really critiquing it as a person who really enjoys good sushi & sashimi.\n\nOmakase bowl:  Decent 4/5 but the chopped fish didn\u2019t have any real umami taste.  I guess since it\u2019s an \u201comakase\u201dbowl and it was ordered off the regular menu (not the lunch special), I had a little higher expectation.  I probably wouldn\u2019t order it again.\n\nBluefin Tuna Don:  Lunch special and 4/5 for the quality of fish and value.\n\nSushi & Sashimi Hachi Mori:  Lunch special 4/5 for quality of fish and value\n\nHamachi Kama: 1/5 was super disappointing and terrible.  It looked so good bcs it\u2019s deep fried BUT bcs was deep fried it was so DRY! Kama should be broiled to keep the moisture of the fish. It was not how a good Kama should taste.  PSA, save your money & do NOT order it.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a solid 4 star restaurant with decent fresh sushi/sashimi but I wouldn\u2019t make a special effort to return.  For me to drive from SGV to the OC, at least 1 dish needs to be a 5 star.",
      "I'm trying Irvine's most popular\u00a0sushi\u00a0restaurant\u00a0so you don't have to. Chances are you've already\u00a0heard about this spot, but they're an elegant sushi bar with SO many menu\u00a0options.\n\nFirst off, we had to start with some yakitori, we got skewered chicken gizzard, bacon enoki mushroom, and pork belly, and their ankimo or monkfish liver appetizer is 100% worth trying.\n\nI was so looking forward to their premium sushi sets because that's how you really judge a sushi restaurant (iykyk), I'm happy to report that they passed the test!\n\nIf you like a little spice, definitely get the yellowtail jalapeno, and I absolutely loved the omakase bowl where you can make your own DIY handrolls from, so fun!\n\nThanks for reading! ^-^",
      "This was our first time at Izakaya and we enjoyed the food very much. We had the Omakase for 4 of us and it was a nice experience.\nOur server was also great!\nWe sat outside and it was good but sometimes heard road noise from loud vehicles."

Save yourself some time and add your name to the wait list once you\u2019re on the way there! The inside is pretty small, so the wait can be fairly long.",
      "This place often has crazy wait times. I added myself to the wait list, and a table was surprisingly ready before I got there. I gave them an ETA, and only had to wait a few minutes for them to finish setting things up. The karaage and pork buns were tasty appetizers. The tonkatsu ramen was awesome! I especially loved the soup. Every spoonful was packed with flavor. They charge 16% tip for every order.",
      "Tonkotsu Ramen was really tasty and did not overly rely on salt. Noodles were fresh and the added vegetables were good too. The infused water was a nice touch and the venue playlist is amazing. Service was great, prompt, and friendly.",
      "It just doesn\u2019t get any better than this. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s the best ramen in America. The tonkatsu broth is cooked for 24 hours and you can taste the depth of flavor in every bite. The crispy chicken is a perfect starter. Served fresh and hot and super crispy. Edamame is fantastic as well as the pork buns. They add the tip on the total, So be careful not to double tip the server. (Unless you want to!) Strip mall has free parking, but the entire area is busy, so you may have trouble finding a spot.",
      "A really lovely late lunch at HiroNori. We were craving ramen and this delivered. I tried the tonkatsu ramen with its creamy, rich broth and Caty opted for the lighter shoyu one. We also grabbed some edamame (salt and yuzu, just a hint ) and a drink. The pork buns were also delicious, though 11 dollars disappeared quickly \ud83d\udca8. Our server, Athena, was friendly and prompt. She checked in on us and answered questions."

I thought they were expensive too but ymmv.",

Food is cooked to order so expect a bit of a wait if you come at a busy time. Located in a business park next to Blizzard campus. Kimchi fried rice, Katsu, and bulgogi bowl were amazing!

The star was my lobster roll! I was impressed with the large full pieces of perfectly prepared lobster. The bun was also done very well as they cut off the sides of the bun and grilled it. This was such a great riff as it improved the balance of the sandwich to filling and added flavor. We finished with some lovely desserts and I really enjoyed the pistachio tiramisu. Our server was excellent and we had a lovely evening. First visit tonight but we will definitely be back to try brunch.",
      "Good variety of options on their menu including seasonal options. Enjoyed the poached shrimp and lobster melon salad. It was light and fresh. The artichoke spinach dip appetizer was the best that I have enjoyed with fresh homemade chips. Good size portion of their lobster roll. They chocolate cake was light and had the right amount of frosting. Modern and comfy decor, they are located in a business park right off the 405 freeway. Chose this place looking for an early dinner option before going to the Segerstrom Center theater. This was a great option with a mid price point and only eight minutes away by streets or freeway. They also have a weekend brunch.",
      "Upscale restaurant near John Wayne airport with good food, service, and decor. It\u2019s on the pricier side, but it\u2019s nothing unexpected given the location and menu.\n\nMy husband and I went for lunch around 11:30 on a Friday without a reservation. They promptly seated us and only a handful of patrons were there, although things picked up around noon.\n\nWe started with the goat cheese and artichoke appetizer. It was on the smaller side (5 pieces) but pretty flavorful. I ordered the crab cake, which was excellent \u2014 succulent and flavorful, especially with the sauce. The fennel salad was interesting. I\u2019m not usually a fan of fennel, but it paired nicely with the crab cake and had a nice, firm texture. My husband ordered the prime rib (medium rare, on the rarer side), which was juicy and flavorful. The accompanying mashed potatoes were also tasty.\n\nOther things to note: The service was great. My husband drinks frequently and our server was quick to come by for refills. In addition, they validated for 90 min parking at the adjacent parking garage.",
      "Only coming here cuz our server Nick C made our experience amazing. Very kind server that tried to make our experience there great. We were a group of 7 and he was perfect for us. A couple of us ordered the vanilla bean French toast for brunch, and found it to be lackluster. There\u2019s better options on the menu other than that. But service and the ambience was perfect",
      "Goldfinch offers a trendy and inviting atmosphere perfect for a casual night out. We enjoyed our visit and found the food to be delicious.\n\nThe spicy tuna was a standout, with a perfect balance of heat and flavor. It was fresh and satisfying. The artichokes were creamy and rich, a classic comfort food choice that hit the spot.\n\nOverall, Goldfinch is a great option for those looking for a lively spot with tasty food and a stylish ambiance."

The beets are firm with a wonderful texture and flavor!! My favorite place to get beets.\n\nTheir Grilled Cage Free Chicken plate is filling, juicy and perfect with the Organic Red & White Quinoa with Tomato Pesto. The quinoa is one of my favorite side dishes.\n\nThe Roasted Mushrooms with Garlic Parmesan Butter and Gochujang Roasted Broccoli were very tasty sides. I would definitely get them again!!\n\nThey have seating both inside and on their patio area. Good customer service!",

This is how the portion looks when you eat inside. This cost about $65 including 2 drinks and a dessert.",

If you\u2019re looking for healthy food def eat here"

However, we ended up waiting about 20-30 minutes for our food to come out, and our waitress was almost nonexistent after taking my order. Food was not really that great, I do not recommend their avocado and chicken sandwich. Their Ceasars salad is okay, and so are their fries.",
      "Food was good I do not like how they push you to order on the little kiosk.\n\nServer was good, refilled our drinks promptly , did take a while to come check on us after food was delivered.\n\nShrimp tacos were well seasoned almost a little too well seasoned very spicy and I like spice !",
      "Great night out! Our server ensured we were able to watch the game and took care of our needs and checked in often. Loved the option to put in our orders ourselves since it let's us look things over and not have the dreaded stare down when you can't make up your mind. Poke nachos were great and guacamole was simple and not over complicated. We opted for a simple burger with added veggies on the side. Burgers were warm, flavorful and came out quickly. My only feedback is that for portions received the price is a bit steep. Ultimately, if you review the menu prior this allows for us to be prepared, but I remember serving sizes being a bit more in the past. Overall great night out and great restaurant."

      "Chic and cozy. Super friendly staff and delicious food. Steak was great but fatty. Garlic bone marrow was awesome, highly recommended.",
      "Amazing drinks, and great steaks cooked to perfection. The wagyu hanger steak is a must try cooked over oak charcoal it has a Smokey flavor that pairs great with the pork chops and apple sauce cocktail(fat washed bourbon)",
      "Tons of cool cocktail options, the wagyu is to die for as expected. But those Brussels sprouts are next level!  Liz and Haley were both awesome and very attentive servers, we were very well taken care of. I was visiting from Seattle, and this was a perfect way to experience the area.",
      "Outstanding whiskey list which they'll breakdown into flights. The server and bartender setup the flight of 3 bourbons and 1 rye expertly. Appetizers were excellent. The wagyu steak was phenomenal. Our sever was very helpful and everything she recommended was delicious. I highly recommend Twenty Eight and look forward to returning.",

      "Delicious. Your dishes are made fresh per order. A little bit of street food. A little bit of traditional. A touch of everything. This shop is adjacent to the HMart in a food court setting. Plenty of seating. Food court staff keeps this area clean.  Come to Jopok!",
      "Go there semi-often and normally get the kimbap (sometimes the tteokboki and sundae), but this time around (a couple of days ago), the kimbap was saltier than normal, the danmuji especially. I hope that was a one-time coincidence and not something that is permanent in the flavoring. Overall, though, the food is good. Aside from this recent experience, I've never had a problem with it.",
      "Jopok Topokki is located inside of HMart, and it is absolutely delicious! I highly recommend their bulgogi topokki. The customer service is amazing as well, the lady who took my order was very kind.",
      "I love this topokki shop most in irvine. I\u2019m korean this is authentic shop and rly famous franchise in korea. The owner is so so kind so I had good time in here try cheese toppoki rly good and kimbap is amazing!!!! Trust me rly good fr",
      "I really love the quality of food here, they are very delicious, fast service and very kind, and it feels like I\u2019m almost in Korea. Korean Sausage and spicy rice cake (Topokki) are my favorite Korean food but I couldn't find anywhere around here that has the good taste and quality I wanted. Now I found a place in Irvine!! I feel so lucky. I usually get Korean Sausage and Topokki but yesterday I tried different menus from there, which were Kimbap, Rose Topokki and a  Fish Cake Udon.\n\nOMG! My friend and I were amazed. First time trying out Rose Topokki. I loved the vienna sausages with cheese in there that really rich the taste of the Topokki and for some reason the taste was less spicy than others but more rich and creamy.\nFish Cake Udon was a kick for us ~ wow~~ you must try this. It doesn\u2019t taste like any other regular udons out there. It is a really good combination with Kimbap and Topokki.\nJust LOVE LOVE LOVE their food!\n\nSometimes I get a little hesitant when I try new menus but I was so glad I did. Known for the Best place for Korean sausage and Toppokki. I strongly recommend you try these two first then try other menus from Jopok, you\u2019ll be glad you try different menus from there, too."

      "First time here and really was hoping to get a prime rib plate described by others, however, this was not my day. Came for lunch prime rib, sides and check out the interior. The cut was in the thin side, not nearly as tender and flavorful as expected. The sauce helped with that, but it being cooked or served more medium didn\u2019t help. Now, it wasn\u2019t busy when we got there (see photo), around 12:30. Seemed like only one server in the main room. It\u2019s always possible the steak was at medium rare when cut and plated, but, if the waitress is busy with other tables/duties, the steak continues to cook. The German potato salad was ok, nothing stood out. The broccoli was what it was. The atmosphere was old world, but seemed goofy to some degree. Service was very good and she was tipped accordingly.  I won\u2019t be visiting again, but we have it a shot.",
      "Amazing food and service.  Been here a few times and every time it was great. Host and waiters are super friendly and nice and the vibe in the restaurant is chill and casual. The food is massive. The entrees are giant plates.  Appetizers are delicious. The crab cakes are amazing. The prime ribs is delicious and the duck was amazing. The cream corn is delicious and horseradish with the prime rib was perfect.\n\nLove this place! Will def be back soon!!",
      "Recently visited this place\u00a0and had a really good experience there celebrating\u00a0my\u00a0relative's b-day. The restaurant is very beautiful inside, the service was fast and friendly. The food was delicious\u00a0and the portions were very generous. I shared the chicken with my kid and we still had leftovers. I also tried the other food that my relatives offered and it was good (especially ribeye steak and duck). Only mashed potatoes\u00a0had some pieces and were not creamy but the rest of the food was good and not overpriced. Paid 652$ including tax and recommended tip for 8 people (3 appetizers, 8 main courses, no dessert) including 2 bottles of wine and 1 alcohol cocktail and everyone had boxes full of leftovers. Thank you.",
      "Old school English fare with a focus on Prime Rib. In its hey day (the 70's to the 90's) Gulliver's was packed most every night. Not so much now. That said, our waitress was very kind and accommodating.  The standout meal for me was the duck. It really over delivered.  Side note: We dined with a couple that has been coming here every year since the late 70's to celebrate their anniversary!",
      "Reasonable price and taste. Recommend grilled steak than prime rib."

      "As of end of April 2024 I heard that this restaurant opened four months ago. For the residents of Shady Canyon, this is great because it adds a nice Italian restaurant with great ambience nearby. The food is good. I like the soup enough that I would order it again. Since we are about 20 minutes away, we probably won\u2019t come here again. Though we will drive further than that for great Italian food. Just saying. Nothing wrong with this restaurant and I wish them the best.",
      "So many choices I will need to come back many times. Staff are super attentive and our waiter was a gem. We dined as a party of ten and service was smooth as silk.\n\nOne of the specials was wild boar ragu over tagliatelle. I loved it. My wife went with the lasagna and it was a meaty joy with Bechamel as is the standard in Europe. For dessert we went with the classic tiramisu.\n\nOur other guests also enjoyed their meals.\n\nI  ready to go back tomorrow.",
      "Nice place, polite staff.\nService was mediocre.\nWaiter, while very nice, polite but between accent and somewhere around Mach 1 or maybe even Warp drive speed of speaking I have no idea at all what the specials were or what the Pizza he was custom making.\nSalad, beautiful presentation and tasted, well not sure. It had so much salt it was almost inedible. I didn't bother to finish. That was more salt than any human should consume in a week, maybe more.\nPizza, best thin crispy crust I've had since leaving NY. 40 years ago. Toppings, were a joke, 1 token Artichoke, 5 mushrooms and 3 or 4 blobs of cheese. The rest was just tomato sauce. Tasty sauce though.\nMains,\nI had the Lamb Chops. 5 on the plate. 2 were so well done that they were just gray and hard. 1 solid Medium-well. Flavor just okay. Nothing to brag about.\nVegetables,  carrots, and Broccoli. Both were seasoned and warm but not cooked.  I had to use my meat knife to cut the carrot, and the only edible part of the Broccoli was the very tip of the crown/flower. Very disappointing.\nWife had the fish, SeaBass and she said it was excellent.\nDesert, I don't know. I asked twice but never got a menu. Waiter never came back to the table. 20 mins.\nServer brought a vanilla Ice Cream with candle for my wife's Birthday. Asked for Waiter 3 times so she could order a Espresso Martini but no luck. I got up, went to the Waiter at the register and ask him for an Espresso Martini for my wife and the desert menu but quite honestly I was done at that point. I just wanted to leave.\nSuch a shame because we ate at their other restaurant in Laguna Beach and it was amazing. We were very excited about going to the new location but a major let down. I think they have only been open a few months so maybe there still working thing out. I'll give it another try in a few months but for now I can't give a very good recommendation. Sorry. I mean at almost $100 per person I expect at least 3-star service and quality.\nUpdate 5/27\nAs to make my point, manager/owner doesn't seem to care what people think. No response to my review? Clearly they know they have a problem and are shy to reply. Never written a review with detail and pictures with no response. To good or bad review. Some have changed my mind and after returning changed my review.\nOh well, other restaurants to visit all over the O.C.",
      "Took Mom to dinner at @oliverstrattoria in Irvine tonight. Oh my\u2026sorry not sorry no pictures of dinner it was so so good. The gnocchi was beyond excellent so pillow soft and delicious. And this\u2026this is orange egg custard with berries. Talk about heaven! Ambiance was wonderful, the staff was welcoming and attentive\u2026.a definite go to for delicious Italian food to splurge on!"

      "So I\u2019m going to this place multiple times usually just to have a beer or a drink and the service is always pretty good because there\u2019s no one really there when I come for lunch but this time I decided to try their burger and fries because every time I\u2019m there for a drink and food always comes out and looks amazing so I went and ordered the burger the server suggested and it was amazing. Sorry I cannot remember the name of the burger and the fries were on point as well. Definitely will go back for a burger. Yes the burger and five combo is $18 but it\u2019s very good.",
      "Definitely cool spot to have some drinks and enjoy with the group of friends! Mac & cheese balls are amazing and the variety of cocktails available.",
      "I love this place, the ambience is amazing! But it honestly comes down to the service and the food.\nThe food had so much flavor I didn't want to stop eating it. Their truffle fries are one of my favorite things to eat, full of flavor and yumminess. Went with my sister and my daughter, and the bartender was so attentive. Even though he was training someone, he never missed a beat. He made us laugh and was very sweet, we had good conversations. He is single, attractive and a Christian man. In case any woman is interested.  Everything was awesome. A definite place to go and eat. Download the app and you get $10 off your first bill..",
      "we had visited for a late lunch / early dinner on a saturday and were lucky that the restaurant wasn't that busy during our visit. we ordered the truffle fries and they were cooked perfectly and tasted so good especially with the dipping sauce. i ordered the \"cowboy\" burger and all the ingredients were evenly proportioned so it wasn't too highly stacked or too much of one ingredient. their beer list was also pretty good and we tried a few as well while we ate. i will also confirm that they do have an outside patio area with what looked like a fireplace or a fire pit. there is also plenty of parking due to the shopping center with plenty of other stores that it is attached to.",
      "I visited the place with my work interns for lunch (party of 3). I had the Smash Burger, it was delicious. What I missed in the burger was caramelized onions and a little zing to taste. Maybe next time I should customize and ask for that. The sweet potato fries could be better, crispier. Mac N Cheeze Balls were phenomenal. Never had them before and they were excellent!"

It wasn't very busy on a weekday afternoon so service was very personal feeling and the atmosphere was great. Additionally, the food was better than we anticipated, especially for what I would consider very fair prices. I got the classic burger and it was very good. I'd say that this was one of the few chain style restaurants I've been to where the burger came out cooked to the perfect medium I requested. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone.",

      "Our recent visit to Paul Martin's in Irvine exceeded all expectations, thanks to their outstanding service. Initially faced with a last-minute change in plans, the staff seamlessly accommodated our large group, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable celebration.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the team greeted us warmly and provided attentive service throughout the evening. Despite the unexpected circumstances, their professionalism and dedication made our night unforgettable.\n\nTheir thoughtful gestures and attention to detail, especially for the birthday celebration, added an extra layer of joy to our experience. Overall, the exceptional service at Paul Martin's turned what could have been a stressful situation into a memorable celebration. We can't wait to return for more remarkable experiences.\n\nOn a side note, the biscuits were perfect but the recipe for the butter cake changed a bit. It needed just a tad of salt. Have you had it before? \ud83d\ude0b",
      "Celebrating a milestone anniversary with a large group. Service (impatient young man) was initially horrible until we spoke with the manager and requested a new server. The new server (young lady) was more efficient and pleasant.\nGreat location while staying at the nearby hotel. The food was good (be sure to ask for fresh biscuits - ours were stale and tasted reheated in the microwave), but to be called seafood pasta, there should be more than shrimp in the dish. The braised short ribs were tough/chewy. The portions are very small for the pricing.\nThe experience was a little choppy. I wished it was a lot smoother. Thank you to the manager on duty on Saturday, February 24th, at 6 pm for trying.",
      "We went to the Bourbon Tasting event last night and it was terrific!  The cocktails, food and service were all great and honestly the value was amazing.  Each cocktail featured a different bourbon (Basil Hayden, Maker's Mark and Knob Creek) and as you'd expect from Paul Martin's they were great, well balanced and delicious.  The food pairings were excellent - each with an interesting twist like the wonderful burrata salad with fried green... tomatillos!  So good!  The chef and the bourbon rep both gave interesting info on the food and drink, but didn't interrupt the flow of the evening.  Very enjoyable - we look forward to the next event!"

      "This place is the bomb! The food is delicious, we ordered 2 briskets, short rib and the flank stake.\nThe brisket is the best one, super thin cut, it melts in your mouth. The short rib is very good but you need to cut so it is not so chewy. The flank is tasty too.\nWe had the light beer and it was cold. Bottles are 500 ml.\nAll the staff is super nice, Frank was our chef and he made sure to cook our meats to our taste, we like it mooing LOL\nBeautiful place and welcoming. Not a lot of place for waiting for your table.\nThis was our second time and we will be back.",
      "Baekjeong Irvine offers an intriguing and immersive Korean BBQ experience that truly stands out. From the moment we entered, we were captivated by the interactive dining concept, where the server expertly grilled the meat right at our table, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the meal.\n\nOne of the highlights of our visit was undoubtedly the outstanding quality of the food. Each cut of meat was impeccably fresh and flavorful, ensuring a memorable dining experience. Additionally, we were pleasantly surprised by the selection of IPA beer available, which complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nThe cleanliness of the restaurant was commendable, and the overall pricing was fair considering the high quality of the food and service. The atmosphere was lively and friendly, contributing to a welcoming dining environment.\n\nHowever, our experience was not without its drawbacks. Visiting on a Saturday noon, we were disappointed to find that there was no bartender available until 5 pm, limiting our drink options. Furthermore, the wait time to be seated was longer than expected, which detracted from the overall experience.\nIn conclusion, Baekjeong Irvine offers an authentic Korean BBQ experience with exceptional food quality. While there were some minor issues with service availability and wait times, the overall dining experience was enjoyable and memorable.\n\nI would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a unique and delicious dining experience in Irvine.",
      "I want to give Angie a big thumbs up! She always works efficiently, and the meat she grills is cooked to perfection. The first time I came here, she served us, and today I met her again, which made me very happy. She even greeted us warmly. Angie is truly an organized and meticulous person, and her service always makes us feel warm and delighted!",
      "Every visit to LA/Irvine can\u2019t be complete unless my family visits this Korean BBQ place.\nWe always get Beef Combo and then order more meat. Servers are always attentive to our needs and the food is excellent. Complimentary steamed eggs and corn with cheese are added plus. Soy bean soup that comes with the beef combo is a must. You can choose from soy bean soup or kimchi stew. Irvine location also has a bar where you can hangout while you wait for your table.",
      "Came before the rush at about 4:30PM and got seated immediately and ordered the Beef S combo! Beef Brisket, Beef Shortrib (or Rib Eye), and Marinated Beef Short Rib w/ so much banchan (side dishes). It also comes with a Kimchi or Soybean paste soup. We ordered the steamed egg into the side of the grill and it was delicious. Service was really good, your host serves and cooks the meats for you. They were really attentive and nice. I came for an early birthday dinner and they were pretty engaging about it.\n\nThe meat and banchan were high quality and tasted good and fresh! The kimchi soup was kind of concentrated and spicy, I think I would order the Soybean paste soup next time. We ordered Japchae at the end and the serving size is worth how much it costs. It\u2019s a huge plate. Great experience, would come again!"

We popped in right at closing time and were treated to the kindest, most considerate service I've ever had!! Beautiful cafe, lovely ambiance, the best of folks own and operate this treasure. Let's not forget about their perfect latte - smooth, full bodied without any bitterness or burnt taste. Absolutely perfect! If you're in the neighborhood, you won't regret stopping in and, I can pretty much guarantee, this will be your new go to. I can promise that we'll be stopping in on our next trip down south \ud83d\udc96",
      "It turns out this is a very popular spot for treating yourself to a delicious weekend breakfast. There's parking nearby, and the caf\u00e9 offers validation if you stay for no more than 120 minutes.\n\nWhen we arrived, they asked if we had a reservation. Regardless, we didn't have to wait long, and we found seats easily. However, there was a large line of people afterward, so it's best to make a reservation in advance.\n\nThe menu features omelets, sandwiches, sweet and savory pancakes, and beverages. The pancake with Nutella and their jam absolutely won me over. I highly recommend this place.\n\nOne thing to note: be attentive when placing your order because, due to the high volume of customers, they sometimes make mistakes or forget some dishes.\n\nThere are seating options both outside and inside. The caf\u00e9 is located in a lovely area, with beautiful buildings, a fountain, and plenty of places to sit and relax.",

The food is so great and I\u2019m so happy to have found a delicious gluten free restaurant like this! Having Celiac in Orange County is tough because there aren\u2019t a lot of great safe options",
      "Staff here was so helpful and outgoing. I think we met just about every one of them. Practically everything here is gluten free and there's so many amazing sounding dishes it was hard to choose. Per our waiters recommendation I got the BLT and the short rib sandwich on gf sourdough (I know!). They were both impeccable. They cure their own bacon and it's a thick cut that's crunchy, but also melts in your mouth. They also have 3 gf beers on draft that is local, Divine Science, and my family that was with me said you couldn't tell it was gf. All of us (gf and non-gf) wish we had this restaurant back home and plan on trying to stop back here in our way to the airport. There is such attention to detail here from the food down to the spoon for the tea. It's impressive. Great ambiance and food!",
      "Amazing food and adorable place! Good variety of options, and where all delicious. Friendly staff and owner. I personally like my soup really hot, and mine was more warm than hot. So only advice would be to request yours hot if that's what you prefer!"

      "We recently celebrated my lovely wife\u2019s birthday at Javier\u2019s, which used to be one of her favorite restaurants. Our evening started off at the Newport Beach location, but it was incredibly crowded. When I asked the front desk for a nice table with a view, we were rudely told that it could take up to two hours to get what we wanted. This lack of customer service was disappointing, so we decided to try our luck at the Irvine location instead.\n\nThe Irvine location was much better in terms of service. Check-in was smooth, and we were seated without any waiting time. The ambiance was pleasant, which set a nice tone for the evening. We ordered some drinks and guacamole for an appetizer. For the main entrees, my wife chose her favorite steak Picado, and I opted for the enchiladas de Mariscos.\n\nWhile the chips and salsa were complimentary, and we appreciated the free flan for my wife\u2019s birthday, the overall dining experience was underwhelming. The portions were small relative to the high prices, which didn\u2019t seem justified. My seafood entree was overly salty and unenjoyable, which was quite disappointing for a place that prides itself on fine dining.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a tres leches cake in addition to the complimentary flan. Both desserts were decent, but not enough to elevate the overall dining experience. The check came to nearly $300 for four people, which seemed excessive given the quality and portion sizes of the food.\n\nIn summary, while Javier\u2019s offers a nice ambiance, the food and service at the Newport Beach location left much to be desired. The Irvine location was better in terms of service but still did not meet our expectations for the price. Unfortunately, Javier\u2019s is no longer a highly recommended place on our list. We were left feeling that we were paying more for the experience rather than the quality of the food.",
      "I went during opening and the patio setting was a beautiful atmosphere. It did get a little loud towards the end when more people were getting seated. The staff were very attentive. I recommend the skirt steak because it just melts in your mouth along with the guacamole. The guacamole is $18, but I honestly think it's an experience everyone needs to eat because it's the best guacamole I've ever had. Our server's name was Gabriel and he gave excellent service",
      "Located inside the Irvine spectrum, Javier's is an upscale restaurant and bar that has always been fun, elegant, modern, with a splash of \"hipness\"\nThe decor is completely nice and intriguing.  The food is excellent,  but a but pricy, however,  the drinks \ud83c\udf78 will completely satisfy your taste buds.\nNow, I would have given this location a 4.5\nBut my visit only earned it a 3.5 to 3.75.\nOne, the reception area was courteous but not attentive\nI felt that we were just numbers to them, and waiting 45 min to be seated at around 930pm and after seemed a bit long.\nSecond,  I felt that walking through the prep area/ kitchen to be seated was not very professional. However, the layout didn't allow for other paths.\nLastly, our server , as nice as she was, seemed a bit distracted, and we felt our service was impersonal .\n\nThe location is superb for first dates , excellent for get togethers."

      "They have great salads and their Tri tip is excellent.  I also enjoy their salmon dinner and their vegetarian burger is excellent too.  The Western Tri Tip Sandwich is fantastic.  They have a really nice atmosphere, very cozy feel.  They also have a complete bar with a great mixed drinks menu.  They do a mean Martini. The bar is a great place to sit if you are alone and have a cocktail with a great steak or the salmon.  I went there the other day and had a martini with the salmon dinner at the bar. Was a perfect way to unwind from work.  People are really friendly and the wait help is very attentive to your needs.  Lots of business staff frequent this place after work for a good meal so you know it is good.",
      "Hi guys today while driving around town and doing some shopping with the family, we stumbled upon the best steakhouse called Wood Ranch Restaurant. The meal was absolutely amazing - I believe we tried everything on the menu and had no complaints. They also had a great selection of cold beers. I must say, the staff was top-notch. I have to give a shoutout to Joseph, who was our waiter, and Jacob, the manager. Both of them were really great people. This location definitely has my seal of approval.",
      "Solid BBQ options. Decent drinks menu. Great vibe and indoor seating. Would eat here again. It's hard to choose where to eat at the Irvine spectrum, this place is definitely good. Staff was attentive and food came out quick. Appetizers were pretty standard.",
      "What out to celebrate our anniversary. Wow did we pick the right place. Amazing service, our waitress Hailey was super friendly, so bubbly, great energy, food was delicious. Fantastic day thank you for the beautiful anniversary sunday ice cream Hailey.",
      "Wood Ranch is a top restaurant for my friends and I when we are looking to end the week with a solid dinner and drinks. The Irvine spectrum location takes a little more effort to get to, but it\u2019s well worth it in the end. If I\u2019m there for happy hour, I\u2019ll get there, killer wings, a couple, Stella\u2019s, and a side; usually mac n cheese or fries w Ranch. If I\u2019m getting a meal, I will either get the pulled pork, brisket, or half chicken. They have plenty of sides to choose from, and all of them are great. I know they have a happy hour from 3PM-6PM Monday-Friday. If you go on a weekend or Friday night there may be a long wait. For the most part we usually get seated right away."

      "This place was great! All the workers are super attentive, we were just stopping by for some te lunch, never been here before, but we go to crab boil places a lot in San Diego. Here was super nice, and clean. All the workers check up on us. Alittle pricey compared to other places but I think it\u2019s worth it! This place is also great because it\u2019s not really loud either.",
      "No marinate , tons of empty shells , sure just dumped it in the bag , no taste or flavor whatsoever.\n\nYou wanna be a copycat but you\u2019re at least 2000 miles from the original boiling crab quality! Need a lot of improvements.",
      "The menu features an array of sides such as corn on the cob, Cajun fries, and garlic noodles, which complement the main dishes perfectly. The portions are generous, making it a great place for sharing and enjoying a communal meal with friends or family.\n\nThe service at Kicking Crab is friendly and attentive, ensuring that diners have everything they need to fully enjoy their meal. Whether you\u2019re a seafood aficionado or just looking to try something new, Kicking Crab at Jamboree in Irvine offers a memorable dining experience with its vibrant atmosphere and mouthwatering dishes.",
      "We ordered the combo #3 last night for dinner and it wasn't great. The shrimp and mussels texture were very bad. We got takeout and were told that the food will be prepared in about 15 minutes, but the food was ready in 6. We were there at 8:05 pm and received the food at 8:12 pm. Seafood should be made fresh and it unfortunately it wasn't. When we got home and was in the process of eating our dinner, the shrimp meat was almost like paste. They were not cleaned and the mussels would almost disintegrate, they fell apart. It was very unfortunate because the dinner was supposed to be for my son's birthday. All I ask for in the future is that we get the food we actually paid for, fresh and worth the $125 plus tip- because it's really unfair for the customer. These pictures are from last night.",
      "I love me some shrimp boil. But in my experience, my recent order was poorly made. The shrimp wasn\u2019t not well cooked, it def still needed some time to cook. Also the corn was over cooked! It did not have a nice crunch as if the corn had been reboiled. Lastly, they have been very stingy with the sauce. It\u2019s less and less in the bad every time! Disappointed."

      "Staff is very rude once they know your food is included with your room. They will not even offer you water. If you are paying out of pocket you get a different treatment. I captured it on video \ud83d\ude05.",
      "The fish tacos were tasty along with the mango salsa which was fresh.  The taco shells were covered with fried cheese on the outside which was a nice touch, and the fish was blackened cod.",
      "I can't give 5 stars because some of the food was only okay (the Macadamia Ahi, and cheesecake),  despite kinda high prices of $20-$35 for entrees. But the sliders, club sandwich, and the guava sorbet were absolutely worth the trip!!\n\nAnd best of all, our server Deanne provided easily the kindest and most superb service I've had in the last 20 years! I'd never even heard of this restaurant before happening upon it via Google \"nearby\", and yet it felt like going to an old high school friend's house for dinner! I will definitely be coming back!\n\nOverall, an incredibly relaxed and low-key restaurant that doesn't try to be anything wacky to stay interesting. Just \"simple\" food done extremely well, with by far the nicest staff you could possibly meet late at night on a weekend!",
      "While I didn't make it to this restaurant, I did stay at the Doubletree and it was a very good Hilton. Rooms are comfortable and service is excellent! Make sure you get the warm chocolate chip cookies!! We did get room service and the food was very good. Thus hotel is in a great location making it easy to get around the area."

      "We had the pleasure of dining at Brio Tuscan Grille in Irvine on a Sunday evening as a large party, and it was great from start to finish! The staff went out of their way to accommodate all 15 of us, ensuring that we were comfortable and well taken care of. The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic \u2013 it's a beautiful space with an, inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe food was delicious, and the service was amazing. Every member of our group loved their meal and drinks. Although we didn't visit the bar area, it looked GREAT from where we were seated. Another highlight is the super convenient location, right next to the parking lot, making it easy for everyone to get there.\n\nOverall, Brio Tuscan Grille exceeded was great! and we will definitely be returning.",
      "A very nice Italian restaurant in the Irvine Spectrum mall. We went last week to celebrate one of our friend's wedding anniversary. The ambience is really nice and up class. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe food has some scope of improvement. We ordered a few dishes; appetizers and main course. The pastas lacked salt. The pizza was too watery due to large tomato slices. The gnocchi and mushroom ravioli were good. Will surely try again.",
      "Went with a large group and service and food were amazing. Good selection of wines and nice desserts, including chocolate.",
      "Had a great experience here! Went for a quick bite and a drink before a movie. Our server Robert was fantastic and friendly. Food was magnificent and the Peroni was cold. Ordered the shrimp and eggplant appetizer which was to die for; the sauce alone on it was perfect with the warm bread served. Prices were fair and the staff friendly. Check this place out for a quick bite at the bar! UPDATE: a few months have gone by and went back to have the shrimp and eggplant appetizer once more. Still easily the best item on the menu and the staff at the bare are phenomenal!",
      "- Expect to spend $30-40 per person\n- Reservations are accepted online\n\nWe came in around 9 pm so we were a little rushed, but that's understandable because the restaurant was closing soon. Food was good, though be mindful that it can be quite heavy if you order something with a lot of cheese/sauce (as you'd expect with Italian food). We came here for an anniversary celebration but they didn't have that option on the online reservation form, so we chose \"Birthday\". We weren't offered dessert, which was a little surprising given our selection but understandable because we came in close to Brio's closing hours (on time for our reservation, however). Attached are a few pictures of our food.\n\nEnjoy!"

When it sold a couple months back I was sad but am happy to say this place is alive and thriving still!!! A very kind man named Mark took it over and has put a breakfast twist to the original concept which is really great. He puts the same care into making excellent quality and delicious food and is just as kind and service minded. Try the breakfast burrito, it is delicious!"

      "Great place to have sumptuous Mediterranean food. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. We ordered hummus, bread basket, chicken koobideh, veggie one which came with saffron flavored rice, salad and grilled chicken or grilled veggies on side. It portrayed classic ambiance with both indoor and outdoor seating options. Plenty of parking around. The vegetarian options are limited.  Would totally recommend it. Will come back again",
      "I recently dined at a five-star restaurant renowned for its exquisite kabobs and was absolutely delighted by the experience. The kabobs were perfectly seasoned and grilled to juicy perfection, complemented by fluffy, aromatic rice that was a dish on its own. The standout, however, was the lunch special, priced at an unbeatable $13, which is a steal for the quality and ambiance provided. This restaurant offers not just a meal but a culinary journey that\u2019s both satisfying and surprisingly affordable. Whether you\u2019re a fan of tender, flavorful meats or well-crafted side dishes, this establishment exceeds expectations and leaves you planning your next visit.",
      "Overall, I had a positive experience \u2014 good prices $$, fast and professional. We visited on a weekday for lunch, so it wasn\u2019t busy.\nThe food tasted good, though it was a bit cold and not as fresh as expected. The Beef Koobideh Kabab was average, deserving a 3 out of 5. A nice touch is the option to order a side stew with your kabab plate; the Gheyme was phenomenal in flavor, earning a 5/5, but it was too watery. They offer in-house Dough, which was not outstanding.\nThe outdoor seating area is great, and there is plenty of shared public parking available.\nOverall, this Persian restaurant is 4 stars for its taste and atmosphere, especially considering the reasonable prices$\nRecommended for its flavor and ambiance.",
      "Definitely a great lunch special. $13 for a kabob of choice. Plus rice and salad. I ordered the combo with beef and chicken kabobs. Juicy and not dry like a lot I have had.\nWould definitely recommend.",
      "Visiting family in OC, with different groups, we had lunch here two days in a row. Having many authentic persian food options in SoCal, I have tried quite a few during the years, but this one is amazingly good. A great variety of options all prepared very well with even in-house baked warm bread. The portions are the largest I have seen served in beautiful plates. The service is very thoughtful, efficient, and friendly. A must try when in town."

      "I hope I can spare someone their time and money with this review. We were shockingly disappointed by this restaurant. It took 90 minutes to get our food, and the food quality was worse than what you\u2019d expect from bad room service. Caesar salad was iceberg lettuce, no dressing, and croutons (see photo). Pizza looked like pizza from a room service kids menu (see photo). The steak was about 2oz (not even close to an entree portion with an entree portion price tag).\n\nThis is marketed as a farm to table restaurant but it most assuredly is not - and trust us, it is not worth your time. We highly recommend going to a restaurant at the Irvine Spectrum and avoiding this establishment.",

      "I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dining twice in this restaurant. The first time as hotel guests, we had to wait a long time to get dessert. It felt like the kitchen had to procure the fruit and ice cream first.  Our second visit, we were part of a tasting party for a future event. The appetizers were delicious, the cocktails were light and refreshing. The beef dishes were both well executed and flavorful. The sea bass was respectable but I did not like the rice and corn risotto that came with it. The roasted cauliflower was surprisingly satisfying even for a non vegetarian like me.\nThe chef heard our input and appropriate accommodations will be made.",

It was a rainy day but I got a warm welcome from the bartenders and enjoyed a By the Slice cocktail while I waited for my Ahi Bowl which was so delicious,  I could have eaten two of them! All the components were so fresh and yummy together! Not cheap at $26 but memorable and I would love to return to have it again.  The menu is limited and the restaurant is on the small side but cozy and friendly and they do have outdoor seating for warmer weather!  Disclaimer- I am a Marriott Associate.",
      "Came here twice whilst staying at the hotel and both times, the food was really good. Both the veggie omelette and the breakfast sandwich were delicious. The chicken apple sausage and breakfast potatoes were also really good. Service wasn\u2019t that quick, but the pool views were great. We were sitting outside and the weather was perfect, so there was no rush on our part either."

      "Since it was Father's Day, the place was super busy. We had reservations & were seated within mins. of our time. The wait staff was really hustling due to the volume of customers. However, they were attentive & polite even while slammed. He never waited more than a min.or, so when we were ready for more meat, a plate needed refreshed or water was getting low. The meat was not over cooked, was tender  & tasty. The salad bar was amazing.",

Tried all kinds of flame-grilled meat brought to our table, including Brazilian sausage, sirloin, flank steak, filet mignon, garlic pork, grilled chicken, and lamb rack were seasoned well, juicy, and delicious.\n\nThe buffet salad bar (included with dinner) has a wide variety of selection and includes lobster bisque soup.  Fried banana, mashed potatoes, French fries, and Brazilian cheese balls ( bread) were also brought to our table.\n\nDessert and drinks were not included.\n\nNote: We used several discounted gift cards purchased from Costco and Sam\u2019s club for the dinner.

      "One of our go-to place every special occasion... I always request the prime rib, fall-out the bone, so tender juicy, melts in your mouth. For me, you can't go wrong. If you you like meat or steak just like I do, just buy that Texas de Brazil gift card  worth $200 for $150 @ Costco. I hope this helps you. Enjoy!"

      "Overall our family rated this place 6.5 out of 10. Here\u2019s a brief summary.\nService- Great! Everyone was helpful and kind.\nAtmosphere- It gives cafeteria vibes. You go in and order your food with a cashier. Once you order, you find a seat and your food is delivered to your table. You fill up your own drink,  grab the  plates, napkins, utensils for yourself as well.\nFood- Nothing special. The chicken was seasoned but the skin felt a little rubbery. The Tips were a bit better, but the salmon was the best of all the protein we ordered. The beans are definitely Cowboy style, meaning tastes like chili and we were hoping for a true baked bean. Wish that would be added to their description. Finally, We\u2019d recommend to totally avoid the carrot cake. Either someone forgot what carrot cake is supposed to taste like or someone forgot to add the appropriate ingredients. We each took a bite and tossed the rest.",
      "Stonefire Grill certainly has the potential to be better. This time it was below average, but I gave them 3 stars because it could have been better.\n\nMany reviews talk about the tri tip, so I figured I had to try it. First the good. It was exactly medium-rare, which I had asked for. It was well seasoned so it had good flavor. But it was cold. Not refrigerator cold, but calling it lukewarm would be providing it with more warmth than it actually had. In fact I ended up dipping it in my beans just to give it some semblance of warmth.\n\nWith the choice of either salad or several choices of sides, I chose the cowboy beans. When I ask the cashier what kind of beans they were she had to ask a co-worker because she didn't know. Not the actual type of bean mind you, she didn't know they were called cowboy beans. The beans were quite tasty, seasoned well with bits of onion and possibly tri-tip amongst the beans.\n\nThe meal was accompanied by two rather doughy breadsticks. Though I might be biased because my boys prepared some fresh breadsticks at home just a couple days ago. Oh, and I also had a beer.\n\nI'd really like to give them another try, but paying 23 bucks for poor service and ill prepared food is a bit of a stretch. Especially when it's essentially served in a fast food environment.",
      "StoneFire grill is so amazing. All of the food is based on a family recipe. This family recipe is too good. Anyone who comes here knows it.\n\nAll of the food is freshly made to perfection. It's fresh and made to perfection. It's fresh. Cooked very well. The restaurant is very clean, very welcoming, and staff is very friendly. The service is warm and treat you right away like a family. The prices are so affordable.\n\nWe love it because the portions are Soo huge and even though it's just for the 3 of us it's always great for some leftover.  You can dine in or eat outside at the patio.\n\nNo wait time. The menu at StoneFire grill has a lot of options to grill from salad, pizza, tri-tip, chicken, and Soo many appetizers. So many good items to list.\n\nWhat we ordered\n- Kids pasta butter and cheese. Oranges.\n- family portion for 3-4. Baked chicken (oil, lemon, garlic) tri-tip, StoneFire chopped salads (tri-tip), breadsticks.\n- pizza\n- tried the spinach artichoke dip. Amazing.\n\nWe've been coming for a while now. The manager and staff are so kind and very understanding. We will definitely come back here again and again. Thank you for having us.",
      "The food here is fantastic, with great service and amazing prices to match. Despite my initial expectation of full table service, I wasn't disappointed; you simply place your order at the register, and they bring the food and drinks to your table. They provide plenty of sauce on the side and actual cutlery, enhancing the dining experience. Additionally, they even bring a cold glass for your beer, adding to the overall satisfaction of the visit.",
      "My first time to Stonefire Grill. It was a pleasant surprise. Iike the style. The tri-tip steak was good. Bbq sauce was good. The mashed potato is extremely tasty. I was impressed with the quality customer service of Mr. Maddox; he is very curtious"

      "The place is super clean. There was only 1 cashier but she was super organized and friendly. The food was very well presented and tasted good but the meat quality is comparable to fast food. The chicken texture is similar to McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets but it was still good. You have a choice of pork, chicken or beef hamburger for the katsu. The curry was light and flavorful. We will come back to try their large variety of other menu items.",
      "I stopped by for a quick lunch and was blown away by the options and values this restaurant has to offer. The staff was super friendly and attentive! Noticing it was my first time, they even threw in a free banana milk. I really enjoyed the yubu pocket set. Will definitely be back to try more of their specialties!",
      "Katsubar is a culinary paradise where every dish is a masterpiece. Their curry is a symphony of flavors that takes your taste buds on a delightful journey. The donkatsu is crispy perfection, with tender meat coated in a golden crust. And their sandwiches are a work of art, bursting with fresh ingredients and innovative flavors. With top-notch service and unbeatable quality, Katsubar is a must-visit destination for food lovers everywhere",
      "The food was good and the quality of each dish is excellent! I would definitely visit again :)",
      "Very nice place and good food!!! Also nice staff\u2026Everything perfect!!! Wanna go again!!!"

      "Very good food with the perfect portion sizes and reasonable prices for the taste. I live on the east coast where you need to pay for parking for many restaurants but here of course it\u2019s free. And if you don\u2019t find a spot in the parking spots by the restaurant, there\u2019s a parking garage hall a block away. This place was very busy so thankfully we were seated right away. It\u2019s very casual inside but looking around, I could tell it is a local favorite. The flavors were delicious. For me, I ordered the spicy pork bulgogi (pretty much the only dish I order when eating Korean because it\u2019s my absolute favorite and am very critical of) and found it to be perfect. I would certainly go back for more next time I\u2019m in town. My wife had her usual bibimbap (one of her favorites), which she couldn\u2019t finish because there was so much food. My daughter had the galbi and soon tofu combo, which she raved about.",
      "Guys if you haven\u2019t checked out this place yet you\u2019re insane!! The food is a solid, homemade five stars family owned business. And we came here for a first time and they brought us complementary dishes. What an awesome place coming back here for sure.",
      "If you are looking for Korean food, This place is for you!\nThey have a lot of menu choices, so if you are not sure where to go, just come here. You  will also love all of their side dishes :)\nI had Maeun Kalbijjim and Tteokbokki. Their size is really big and my husband I couldn\u2019t even finish them. The kalbi in kalbijjim was SUPER SOFT and I really loved it. The tteokbokki was also amazing, just enough to spicy and the sauce has good richness.\nThe server was very nice, so if you want to get some recommendations, just ask her! She will gladly give you good options.\nIt can\u2019t be more authentic than food in Korea.",
      "Got the Naengmyeon (cold noodles) and Dolpan Tuna & Kimchi Rice. I loved the naengmyeon especially. The portions are really big and good for sharing. They have unlimited yummy side dishes such as cucumber salad, kimchi, radish kimchi, fish cake, acorn jelly, etc.\nThe place is run by Korean ladies who were so cute and sweet\ud83d\udc9eWould definitely come back again!\nInsta: @rach.foodie",
      "Very delicious and authentic Korean food. As a Korean, this place is two thumbs up!! I had Tofu soup and hot stone spicy pork&kimchi and it was better than BCD Tofu. The spicy pork & Kimchi was very tasty and love the smoked taste on the pork. Definitely will go back there with family and friends! So happy to find this place near OC!"

      "My dad and I come here every time we visit Southern California. We typically always go right at opening and they are not too busy. Dogs allowed on the patio. The tacos are AMAZING! Best shrimp taco I've ever had. I wish I could get the recipe! Guacamole is good.",
      "I recently visited Puesto, a Mexican restaurant known for its beautiful decor and friendly service. The interior design is stunning, creating a vibrant and inviting atmosphere that truly sets the stage for a memorable dining experience.\n\n\ud83c\udf7aUpon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the staff, who remained attentive and pleasant throughout my visit. I started with a michelada, but unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark, lacking the distinct flavor one expects from this classic Mexican drink.\n\n\ud83c\udf79 I decided to switch to a mojito, which was an improvement but still fell short of being truly satisfying.\n\n\ud83c\udf2eWe ordered a variety of tacos and ceviches. The tacos were undeniably delicious, with rich flavors and fresh ingredients.\n\n\ud83d\udcccHowever, I did find them to be a bit overpriced, especially considering that they arrived at our table only lukewarm.\n\nThe ceviches were enjoyable, though the long wait time for our food was a notable downside.\n\nAnother challenge was the parking situation\u2014it was quite difficult to find a spot nearby. Additionally, the cleanliness of the restrooms left something to be desired, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\n\ud83d\udcccIn summary, Puesto has a lot of potential with its gorgeous decor and friendly staff, but there are areas that need improvement, such as food temperature, drink quality, and overall service speed.\n\nRatings:\n\nService: 3/5\nAtmosphere: 4/5\nFood: 3/5\n\nWith a few tweaks, Puesto could truly shine. I hope to see these improvements on my next visit.",
      "The food was good, but very pricey. Service was great and we had window seats to see the tortillas being made. Ask about parking validation, it said it was complimentary for two hours and then charged 10.",
      "Taco Tuesday is amazing! My go-to tacos are the filet mignon and shrimp. They're half off on Tuesdays and \"Snacks and Shares\" are also half off. Our server was Maria and she was incredibly kind and attentive. Definitely coming back soon!",
      "This place is fantastic! Really great upscale Mexican food in Irvine. There are limited vegan options on the menu, but it\u2019s pretty easy to modify the vegetarian dishes to become vegan. My favorite tacos were the mushroom- there\u2019s a stone fruit salsa on them that is SO so good!"

      "I love DonerG but this specific location is kinda bad.. I ordered doner saltado, the fried egg is still raw, the fries i mean i saw them fried it before serving to me, but it was fried too quick that is still cold in the middle, the rice is overcooked, kinda lost my appetite. For 15$ it should atleast be ok. But this location kinda ruins it. Also ordered beef pita sandwich, and the beef is cold, kinda disappointed i spent 30$ and honestly not worth it.",
      "The food prepared by Pati and Colton was phenomenal. I was hesitant to try this place but the crew welcomed me in and recommended to try the wrap which was delicious. Very professional and kind customer service.",

They did an awesome job with the atmosphere with super high ceilings and attention to detail. Only problem is may feel dated in a few years.\n\nThe food was excellent. The oysters were decent but not recommended. They have better options. Same with the burger, they have better options unless you have to have a burger. But all other dishes were well prepared, relatively create and very good.  If you have a date you want to impress, I would take her here.",
      "Nothing but an excellent service and exceptional warm Vibes.\n\nOur first time and it will not be the last one. Since this is a first visit, we asked Victoria (one of amazing team) to pick for us. All plates were her choice and I can tell that Victoria NAILED IT!!!\n\nThe place has a unique decorative theme that i never seen anywhere else.\nThere are multiple sections, we sat at the Library theme wall. There was a hidden room behind the books like secret locations but it was for private groups events.\nThere a  patio and very decorative bar.\n\nForgot to mention, that when we called the call went to VM due to line been busy. Couple of minutes after we received a call from the restaurant to return our call!!! That was very respectful to me, I really appreciate it.\n\nThis is a MUST TRY  experience.\n\nThank you team.",
      "This is a super cute spot for brunch. The restaurant is clean and staff is helpful and so friendly. We ordered the Benny eggs, green chilaquiles and A\u00e7a\u00ed waffles. They were all so good and perfectly seasoned. For dessert we ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake which was a little too sweet for our liking. My friend mentioned it to our waitress and she has no problem taking it back and off our check. The staff and beautiful restaurant made it such a pleasant lunch that we will be coming back.",
      "First time here for brunch and not a bad experience. The food was quite good, and they had a great menu of brunch offerings. Enjoyed a mimosa and a michelada with some chilaquiles and chicken and waffles. Everything was very tasty. My only complaint was that the type of beer they used for the michelada was really bitter. Service overall was good, although I think we were helped by around six different people in the time we were there, and we weren't quite sure who our waiter was. Nevertheless everyone was very friendly. A little on the pricey said as most things are these days, just over $100 for two people, but the portions were generous enough.",
      "Our second time at Benny and Mary\u2019s and really enjoyed our food. Service and atmosphere. The menu has changed since April. We ordered the brussel sprouts and the shrimp ceviche for appetizers and just like last time the brussel sprouts is the best I have ever tasted. Very nice and crispy great flavor SNA stehe goat cheese takes it to the next level. The shrimp ceviche was very nice and my wife who is a big fan of ceviches said this was one of the best she has had. For main courses we ordered the bacon cheeseburger 5 stars, the osobuco short ribs 5 star, the salmon was amazing, well cooked and the fried rice and bok Choy accompanying the dish were so flavorful and complimented the salmon so nicely. Best entree from my view. We also got the 18oz ribeye. It was cooked well but I wasn\u2019t crazy about the black garlic butter sauce. I would give the steak a 4 star. The side mushrooms are sweet so a bit different than the side mushrooms that you get at other steakhouses. The restesraunt was bustling on this Saturday night with a private party. Our server was John C, who was awesome.  Very attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the menu and recommended great cocktails.  I didn\u2019t realize last time that we were here that there is also a speakeasy hidden in the library. I took a picture when a couple entered it. Pretty cool."

      "Went for a quick drink and appetizer before a movie. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine and charcuterie board. My friend had allergies to gluten and the bartender was accommodating and served us an additional side of cucumbers. Great ambiance. Good quality wine and food. Prices were reasonable. Friendly staff. Parking varies on day and time.",
      "My wife and I had dinner here for the first time. I like the ambient. It's good for private conversation between family. Our waitress was super nice. The entr\u00e9e was fine, but not as good as I expected. We ordered lamb rack with saut\u00e9ed mushroom and slow toasted beef shortrib. The waiting time between soup and main courses was a little long. The ribs was really good, juicy, tasty. The lamb was somewhat dry in my opinion. The mushroom was the problem. It was toooooo salty. I drank two and half glasses of water to handle it. Hope it will be better in next time.",
      "I had such a great experience at The Winery Restaurant & Wine Bar! The food was excellent as well as the service. The staff consistently checked in on my group to make sure we were always refreshed with drinks and/or anything we needed. Donnie the manager was always making his rounds to double check on everything and made our experience a one to remember. I\u2019ll definitely refer this place to my family/friends and be back to enjoy it myself.",
      "We went for Thanksgiving and enjoyed the meal thoroughly from the appetizer to the main and the dessert. The salad (without the blue cheese) was excellent, while the short rib was a real standout. Definitely on the pricey side, but really the service was great and the overall hospitality was outstanding.",
      "I had lunch here today and I must say it was a delightful experience. The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly the carne asada tacos. They were absolutely fantastic - the meat was tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  At $20, I think it makes going out for lunch affordable.\n\nThe restaurant's decor was also a feast for the eyes. The ambiance was warm and inviting, with a beautiful blend of rustic and modern elements. The music was like lounge R&B at nice volume. I'd make it a bit more global but it wasn't bad.\n\nThe staff was attentive and professional. I was told that wine tastings are not available any longer which is disappointing.\n\nI am hoping to come back and taste some of the other dishes. Perhaps during happy hour.\n\nThank you for your hospitality."

      "This hot pot restaurant is very interesting. They use bamboo sticks to skewer the ingredients, which is very unique. We ate a lot. The ingredients are quite rich, including seafood and various types of meat. The all-you-can-eat price includes all the food, so we felt very satisfied and it was worth the money. Also, the dining environment is great.",
      "Ate here 2x before writing this review. This is a skewer hot pot place and there is definitely a learning curve the first time. There were so many selections on skewers that it was difficult to choose. The fridge had several levels that I didn't get a chance to notice them all until my 2nd time around. It's definitely a scavenger hunt each visit.\n\nThere are some rare finds here that are generally not offered at other shabu places. Like duck blood, duck feet, bamboo fungus (pith), giant prawns, crab meat, etc. Nice To Meet You have it all in one easy to access fridge. We noticed more selections on weekends than weekdays, especially the duck blood. It really fresh and runs out fast.\n\nFor the non-spicy people, there are definitely choices here. The broth comes with 2 choices (or you can go with one, same price) and we loved the beef and tomato broth, both are non-spicy. For meat choices we order off the menu AND we get skewered meat. The kids prefer Flat Iron Steak. Ribeye is pretty good too.\n\nEating with skewers is fun. Definitely an experience. The Brown Sugar Sticky Rice Cake also hits the spot for sweet tooth lovers. Reminds me of the sticky rice cake at Night Markets.\n\nThe seats are spacious and can accommodate large parties.\n\nIf everyone in your party can eat spicy, then this is definitely a worthy spot to visit. But this is an awesome place for non-spicy people too.\n\nSee my pictures for more tips.",
      "The Nice To Meet You Skewer HotPot truly shines with its exceptional hotpot offering. The broth was rich and aromatic, creating a delectable base for cooking the skewers. The balance of spices and seasoning was impeccable, resulting in a truly unforgettable flavor experience. Additionally, the variety of ingredients provided ample options for customization, ensuring each diner's preferences were met. It's evident that great care and attention to detail went into crafting this remarkable hotpot.",
      "We visited Nice to Meet You last Saturday for my boyfriend's birthday. The restaurant is located in a plaza with plenty of parking. Our party had 10 adults and 3 kids. We were greeted by the friendly staffs and got us seated right away. The restaurant was clean and the d\u00e9cor has a hint of traditional Chinese flare mixed with modern feel.\n\nAfter a quick glance on the menu, we ordered some meat entrees and two flavor soup , one pork and another their signature spicy soup with medium spiciness for the adult and pork soup for the kids. I think split pot options are wondering to have when you have kids.\n\nAfter ordering, all of us headed to grab some free appetizers and sauce. The selection on the appetizers were impressive. I think there were at least 15 different types of appetizers offered. My only complaints was to wish for a larger plate! Kids of course went straight into the drink stations (non alcoholic) to grab what they desired.  Restaurant also provided their sauce combo recipe for the customers or you can do your own mixology to create that unique sauce for yourself! The salad bar and dessert bar was remarkable. We had to keep reminding the kids to hold their dessert desire till after dinner.\n\nAll the meat entrees came right away. I personally love the way beef. But make sure you don't leave in the soup for too long. As soon as the color turned, pick up the wagu and eat it! The skewer selection in the fridge was massive. I was not able tried them all! The large fridge with plates of ingredients was superb! I honestly never had so many fresh hot pot ingredients offered at a restaurant. They even offered abalone, which I love! The shrimp ball is another one of my favorite.\n\nAll 13 of us were stuffed with yummy food when we walked out. We are very satisfied with our dining experience. The ingredients were fresh and the service was great. I cannot wait to come back again!",
      "My friend recommended this restaurant to me, since I enjoy hotpot, and yes I have been to this place for so many times.\nI'm overjoyed that I no longer have to drive to Rowland Heights to eat skewers hot pot.\nMy first impression of this place was that the decorations were ancient with Chinese style but modern, and because it was new, everything seemed clean to me.\nThey have a large fridge with a variety of meats and vegetables to choose from, as well as a sauce bar with a variety of sauces. So far, the salad bar and dessert bar have been excellent.\nI chose pork bone soup and mushroom soup, both of which were delicious, especially the pork bone soup. The meats and vegetables were both fresh.\nSo far, the service on the day I came was good, and they were very friendly. The price is reasonable, Im sure I will be back.\nSo far, the service has been excellent, and the staff has been extremely nice. The price is reasonable, and I am confident that I will come back many times."

As usual, in almost all establishments, you can walk right in and sit down at the bar in spite of the wait.\nIt took a little while for Amber to acknowledge us, but found out that she was training a \"new guy\" and that always screws up the timing. Once greeted, she was pleasant, friendly, helpful, and efficient.\nOrdered a couple of Blondes \ud83c\udf7a for my sister and myself.\nAlso ordered Avocado \ud83e\udd51 EggRolls and mac-n-cheese balls to start.\nGood stuff!!!\nI had the seared ahi salad and sis had the mini BJ pizza. Both tasty and large enough for both of us to take the remainder of each dish home with us.\nWe ultimately had a pleasant dining experience.\nPricing was reasonable.\nWorth your time",

Service was exceptional and it was nice and cool inside while it was super hot outside.",
      "Came here eat in and take out many times. It is a good restaurant with standard American food. People are nice and helpful. I think the traditional American food like burger and fries are pretty good. I am sure there are many good dishes but the Cajun dish is kinda disappointing. We ordered this last time to try it out, it was way too salty and doesn't seems like or taste like Cajun food. You would know what I mean if you have tried the authentic Cajun food. But overall it is a good restaurant with nice environment.",

Huuuge thick slices of tuna and salmon tataki's with a classic wafu dressing. Their unagi don is awesome too and is such a great combo with the seafood salad. The unagi is cooked to perfection and is very fresh and not super boney. Love the fact that you have the options to choose between white and brown rice!\n\nThe tatsuta age (fried chicken) was great as well. Nicely seasoned and juicy!\n\nThe udon they use is on the thinner side and I abosolutely loooove it. Super yummy. Also, this isn't pictured but I bought a salmon teriyaki plate to take home and I am obsessed. The salmon was sooo large and thick and the teriyaki sauce was perfect!\n\nIt's takeout/eat in service at the moment and I have no complaints! Order first and then grab a table. Quick and easy.\n\nDefinitely recommend!!",
      "Counter service. Very good quick donburi, noodles and rolls with authentic Japanese flavors. Dashi/broth is very good. Sushi is not fancy, but is quality ingredients. Service is very thoughtful and they are very quick in preparation. Highly recommended.",
      "$8 Udon in Irvine, heck yes!!!\n\nMy husband took me here cause he used to go frequently when he lived in the area.\n\nIt was delicious!!\n\nThere is plenty of parking, dine in can happen if you are ok with take out bowls and utensils (due to a shortage of employees, they cannot serve anyone like a restaurant), and there is water available.\n\nI ordered the simple udon with tempura flakes that included spinach and it was amazing! The best part was how affordable it was!!\n\nI tried my husband\u2019s warm soba noodle soup and egg and chicken with rice. It was all so good!!\n\nWould definitely come back here and recommend it to many!\n\nIt\u2019s just a shame that so much dine in plastic containers are being used and wasted.",
      "Suba was 5/10\nNever had worst sushi/rolls so tasteless\nOdun was great 8/10\nMeckel fish was very dry 5/10",
      "This is one of my longtime favorite restaurants in OC with some of the best Japanese food, but I absolutely cannot stand the current takeout container only service. Not only does it create so much plastic, it pales in comparison to the seated dining prior to the pandemic and dradically decreases the quality of experience here. It's been long enough, PLEASE bring the old dining experience back, what you have now just does not do your delicious food or loyal customers any justice."

      "Five star experience, five star price for good Mediterranean food. Best thing we ordered? The appetizer platter! It fed us till we were almost too full for our entrees! Very pretty place to dine in. Service was also quite excellent. Their great reputation in the OC is well deserved.",
      "First time here and great place but food wasn\u2019t to die for, I would give it a try again with other dishes.",
      "My wife decided  that she would like to eat out late afternoon on Mother's Day. We had celebrated Mother's Day on Saturday instead to avoid the crowd. We were told by Zov's that they could seat my family at the bar at 5:30pm. We got there and to our surprise and delight, they seated my family at a table. (instead of the bar) A moment later, the manager came and explained that they had seated us at a table by mistake. We offered to move to the bar, but was told that because of my children, we could not be seated at the bar. He said they would figure it out and left us at the table. I could see that the restaurant was very crowded with other families celebrating Mother's Day and felt badly, but I appreciated the kind and calm response of the manager. The food was good and the service was great!",
      "My husband, 10-year old son and I love coming to Zovs. It's a neighborhood gem with weekend live music. I love the Moroccan Salmon Salad, so delicious and a good size portion - the salmon sits on the salad with a nice tasty authentic mujadara next to it. Great protein dish. My husband loves the Kebob Two Way and my son orders off the kids menu. We tend to come back for our favorite dishes. The dishes are pricey but the food is delicious so we keep coming back. Sorry but I only have photos of the pretty dessert of the Ridiculous Sundae that Zovs gave me for my birthday. Not only does it look divine but it was yummy! How can it not be delicious, just look at it! I will post photos of our meal the next time. Parking is easy located in at the Orchard Hills Shopping Mall. Love the outdoor dining and live weekend music.",
      "Another location with an incredible atmosphere; I loved the outdoor patio. Both the food and drinks were spot on and packed with flavor. The service was efficient and attentive. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town!"

      "Honestly was blown away by tacos. They have a different flavor but a very good flavor out of all the tacos I highly recommended the mushroom taco amazing. Honestly hits different very delicious great flavor.",
      "We went to Cha Cha's Latin Kitchen during the OC Restaurant Week. We really liked the green salsa with the chips. The Sopes were flavorful but a little messy and I wish they had a meat option. The Posole had a milder flavor than what i'm use to but was still tasty. We got the Crab and Shrimp Enchiladas and the Salmon. While they were both good, we probably wouldn't get them again. The Flan dessert was super sweet and extra creamy, which I enjoyed.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively and the outdoor seating was cozy since they have heaters.\nAnd there's plenty of parking in the plaza.",
      "My bf and I got the ceviche sampler ($16), queso fundido with chorizo ($14), and caldo ($25). Our friend got the salmon. The chips came out first with 3 different salsas. Nothing super unique about the chips. The ceviche was solid. It had a strong flavor. The queso fundido was ok (not as good as the one I had in Mexico obviously). It had too many potatoes, and I didn\u2019t taste any chorizo. It comes with 5 tortillas, so it was surprisingly filling. The caldo had great flavor, and the seafood was tender. Ambiance was nice, and service was good",
      "Great service and good food!  Highly recommended dishes: guacamole, short rib taco, and mushroom taco.",
      "7/3/2024\n\nHad a really good salad and the grilled chicken was delicious. The server was was very friendly and made good recommendations. Great vibe too and everything is clean. Very enjoyable second visit.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nAll the food was really good and the staff was friendly and went above and beyond to make sure my friend in a cast was comfortable. Good food, good friends, good times."

      "Food portions are really tiny.\n\nSituated in a large strip mall in Irvine, this is a good-sized restaurant.  Food choices are mainly Vietnamese-Chinese fusion.  I didn't particularly find the food really all that creative.    With just a slight variation from what I might find from a better quality local Pho type of restaurant.\n\nI felt as if this restaurant was trying to make it more \"upscale\" by charging more and serving less.\n\nAs for overall atmosphere and cleanliness,  they are doing a good job.\n\nIt was worth a visit, but I probably wouldn't come back for lack of value.",
      "The food truly is so delicious and unique enough to impressive my foodie family. However, it is insanely loud inside, makes you feel like you\u2019re at a college dining hall. I would highly recommend booking a table outdoors - it is much quieter and you can actually hear each other speak.\n\nAs far as the food, I would highly recommend the beef belly and the beef tongue stew. Both are so unique and amazing.",
      "My colleague and I decided to try a new spot for our weekly lunch and opted for this place, intrigued by its Vietnamese fusion cuisine. Located in Heritage Plaza, it offers ample parking space.\n\nWe visited on a Thursday afternoon, and the place was bustling. Despite a short wait, we were promptly seated. To avoid wait times, especially during peak hours or if you have a large party, it's advisable to make an online reservation. The wait staff and our server were friendly, and the vibrant ambiance along with ample seating made for a pleasant dining experience. The restaurant also features a round bar serving alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe menu was straightforward, and we ordered a wild berry matcha latte, chicken fried rice, banh mi chao - bo kho, beef tongue banh mi, and fish garlic noodles.\n\nThe wild berry matcha latte was good, though it had more ice than drink, making it somewhat pricey for the quantity. The chicken fried rice was excellent and met our expectations. The pork belly in the banh mi chao was good but lacked the depth of flavor found in the beef tongue banh mi, which was flavorful and satisfying. Unlike traditional banh mi, this place serves the bread on the side with the fillings on a pan.\n\nThe fish garlic noodles were tasty but arrived 20-25 minutes late, leaving us wondering if the chef forgot the recipe. \ud83d\ude02\n\nOverall, the food was delicious and flavorful, but the portion sizes were small for the price. You might end up paying around $30 but still feel hungry due to their portion sizes. If you\u2019re in the area and want to try Vietnamese fusion cuisine, this place is worth a visit. Just be prepared to spend a bit more if you're looking for a filling meal.",
      "Nep Cafe, located in a bustling plaza in Irvine under the Kei Concept umbrella, offers a vibrant Vietnamese fusion dining experience. We ordered their dinner menu and were impressed by several dishes.\nThe Beef Carpaccio was exceptional, earning a perfect 5/5 for its deliciousness\u2014we're still craving it!\nThe Garlic Noodle and Whole Branzino both scored well with ratings of 4/5, though diners should be cautious of small fish bones in the branzino.\nThe Seafood Ceviche received a 3/5, reflecting a middling experience.\nHighly recommend trying their delightful Coconut Matcha\u2014it's truly delicious.",
      "Elevated Vietnamese cuisine\n\nI walked in at 7pm on a Saturday with no reservation for a party of 7. We were told that the wait would be an hour.\nWe got lucky and we're seated much faster!\n\nThe cocktails were very good!\nI personally like sweet and refreshing drinks, and I recommend the little saigon cocktail.\nIf you prefer a balanced drink, the Em Oi! Is very good. Have some who enjoys stonger flavors? The chapter ii is the choice for you.\n\nAll the plates have great portions. As a party of 5, we all were able to share bites of all appetizers. The shrimp salad was my favorite, it was very refreshing, and the dressing was flavorful.\n\nAll main dishes had generous portions. As a party of 5, we ordered 4 plates and were all very content and full!\n\nThe desserts were also quite rich!\nMy personal favorite of the three was the banana bread. The top of the banana had a torched turbinado topping which really elevated.\n\nI really appreciated that the menu overall noted common allergies and intolerances. As someone that is lactose intolerant, it helps decide whether a creamy menu item is ok to eat \ud83d\ude0a"

      "Cozy Brunch Spot with Room for Improvement\n\nEveryday Eatery in Sand Canyon Plaza offers a cozy cafe vibe and a healthy brunch menu that hits the spot.\n\n\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Delicious Brunch Fare: From avocado toast to hot cakes and waffles, the brunch options were delicious, fresh, and well-prepared. The variety of drinks, including iced matcha latte, americano, and Earl Grey tea, catered to different tastes.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f Casual and Friendly Atmosphere: The cafe exudes a casual and friendly vibe, perfect for hanging out with friends. The patio seating adds to the relaxed ambiance, making it an enjoyable spot to spend time.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Staff Service: However, I found the staff to be lacking in friendliness and could benefit from more training in customer service. Improving staff interactions would enhance the overall experience for guests.\n\n\ud83d\udebd Clean Facilities: On a positive note, the washroom was clean, reflecting the restaurant's attention to hygiene.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Reasonable Prices: The prices were reasonable, offering value for money considering the quality of the food and atmosphere.\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Plan to Return: Despite the minor issues with staff friendliness, I plan to return to Everyday Eatery to try more of their food. I'll update my review next time based on my experience.\n\nOverall, Everyday Eatery is a charming brunch spot with delicious food and a welcoming atmosphere. With a little improvement in staff training, it has the potential to become a top choice for brunch enthusiasts in the area.",
      "What a wonderful breakfast/brunch spot. I dropped my wife at an appointment and decided to stop and have breakfast. I found Everyday Eatery in close proximity and what a find. I ordered coffee, OJ, and the spinach and feta omelet. The food was so good and the restaurant was quite clean with a pleasant ambiance. Courtney assisted me with ordering and delivered my food to the table, and she was terrific as well.\nI highly recommend this great breakfast spot.",
      "This just became our favorite breakfast spot and we\u2019re not even from here! We were so impressed with the quality of food and portions for the price, plus the coffee (latte\u2019s) are delicious! We also highly recommend the breakfast burrito! It can get busy and it\u2019s not very large inside, although on a nice day (like today for us) we were able to sit outside and it was beautiful. It\u2019s a walk up and order and they bring your food to you. When we left, the line was out the door, but rightfully so! It\u2019s well worth the wait!\n\nWe\u2019ll be back for sure when we\u2019re in the area again!",
      "It was not a planned visit but the vibe/atmosphere were amazing. Foods were okay to me but better than plain breakfast meals. I wouldn't travel to this place but highly recommend if it's a quick option.",
      "What horrible customer service! My wife, son and I went during the lunch rush for some breakfast, juice and coffee. The place is pleasant but there is very limited seating -- indoors and out was all full. We noticed a 4-top table with one person sprawled out with a laptop and folder taking up all the seats for over an hour. Turns out it was the manager Tatiana! We actually asked if she could swap for a single seat since there were 3 of us and she said no! Wow. Just Wow."

Just the right amount. The gyoza dumplings were tender with the perfect crisp. With a sensational array of sauces. Very nice server. Great recommendations.\n\nWill highly recommend to anyone who loves culinary arts.",

      "The Chinese chili chicken strips and Bibimbap bowl were delicious! The flavor profile of both dishes was exactly what my taste buds crave. Sweet, spicy, and savory. I\u2019ll definitely be dining here again to try more menu items.",
      "We came here several times and liked most of the items which included the crispy chicken wings, and burger sliders. However, the place could use a thorough cleaning (I hope at least once in a while) this should include all the tables and chairs (felt sticky and unclean), the floors, and the doormat (probably need a new doormat). Most importantly, the cooks; uniforms needed to look crispy and clean. (We noticed a male staff walking in and toward the back kitchen ( his outfit appeared to be a bit filthy). We would love to come back but for these reasons, we will wait for a while before returning. This review stemmed from our sincere honesty and constructive feedback for improvement.",
      "Chicken nice and crispy - I've eaten here a good number of times. Only gotten sick once but that don't stop me from coming back. I came closer to closing and they didn't kick me out so that's great customer service! Kudos for cooking me a fresh cup of hot water when they don't serve if. Ambiance is a bar style. Waiters and waitress chat to keep you company. Way to go!"

The place was clean with friendly staff. I enjoyed my sandwich and found the rice to be too salty for my taste.\n\nI am not reducing their stars for the rice. As everybody else, five total, liked the rice, they still get five stars for food.  Their service is not quick. Which negatively affected how long we had to eat.",

They completely ignored everything we asked for!\nLuckily, the manager came and checked if we needed anything, and we told him he came back with what we asked for.\nThe waiter said we will make sure to do something for my birthday, we waited for 10 more minutes, and no one even bothered to ask! So we left.\nI m very disappointed\nThis is my 5 visit and second visit in one month, and definitely, it was the worst."

      "Was visiting from out of town and always on the prowl for great burgers during my travels. There are some truly great burger joints in So Cal and The Cut is right up there with the best of them. I always start with the basic burger, and this one did not disappoint. Cooked perfectly to medium rare and seasoned well with a burger to bun ratio that was spot on. The bun held up well and I devoured it immediately. The fries were fantastic as well with plenty of garlic and seasoning to satisfy my needs. The atmosphere is positive with plenty of seating and access to the outside world. Staff was a pleasure to chat with and seemed very proud of the business. Will definitely return when in the area.",
      "I went there on a Sunday for father's day my kids took me because I love burgers and this place did not disappoint we started with the shishito peppers which were very good I got the cut burger expensive but very good my wife got the chilaquiles and my kids got the truffle burger and the sweet heat burger all were tasty. The tater tot were delicious crunchy on the outside and the sweet potato fries were on point. The service was good everyone there was friendly and the butter cake was delicious.",
      "I'm a burger snob and I've never had a better burger.  I love the savory.  They recently removed some other fantastic burgers unfortunately .   Really wish the prices were a little less, but besides that, AMAZING food!  Please don't lessen your quality Cut!\n\nI also have tried the biscuits and gravy..... Woah .. unique and delicious\n\nAnd the coconut shrimp..... Yeah it's deep fried of course..... But wow.... They crush it on flavor!",
      "Without a doubt the most exceptional service received at The Cut. We had arrived and were quoted a 20-minute wait and were offered a seat at the bar in the meantime. A table opened up and the staff were quick to let us know. The exceptional service did not stop there. We were greeted by our server, Lisa, who was truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to service, thoughtfulness, and respect. Being my first time there, my friend who recommended it was a regular, I ordered the classy burger with a fried egg, a salad and pancakes, I was hungry lol. Lisa was so kind to consider the cost and mentioned that with each burger there is a side, and asked if I wanted to have the Ceasar salad in a smaller portion as my side which suited me well. The food was great, and I would recommend anyone to enjoy their vast menu of very tasty meals. If you like Poutine, savory, sweet and much more this place checks all the boxes. You won't be sorry you visited!",
      "I\u2019ve been disappointed with so many burger spots in Orange County, so I was expecting the same with The Cut. Thankfully, I was very wrong. The sweet and spicy burger was one of the best i\u2019ve ever had, the beer was fresh, and the service I got from the bartender was fantastic! I will definitely come back!"

The size of the burger and the sandwich is big, you can be full easily with the fries. Service is various depending on where you sit. It is a nice place for a quick American meal.",
      "What can one say about an Islands that has not already been said? The atmosphere of this restaurant chain is family-friendly, fun, and super clean. Even the restrooms are kept in impeccable order. The food is always delicious and the staff is very courteous. Plus, as a surfer and skiing advocate, i can't get enough of surf/ ski programming on the TVs. For this review, I would like to focus on the staff, as they are part of what makes every Islands visit exceptional.\n\nI had placed my order on the app, only to have the app crash and lose my order. Now i had very detailed in placing the first order, so that when I had to do it again, I was a little frustrated, to say the least, and missed adding two items the second time around.\n\nUpon arrival at the restaurant, I noticed that upon paying, the price was less than I expected, and this was when I noticed my mistake. The staff quickly took things in hand, modified my order, saying it was no problem, and even added a drink I had not considered until I saw what was provided in my \"little's\" order.\n\nIt did take a few minutes longer to prepare the additional items for our order, but the staff offered us complimentary drinks while we waited and were super friendly, to the point that three different staff members reviewed and check on everything while we waited.\n\nThis level of customer service is not really something I feel can be taught. It's something that comes from within a person who ensures they are doing their best job while ensuring the customer is satisfied with the service they are receiving. It's a level of professionalism that you don't find very often in large chain organizations, but this Islands has in spades.\n\nI commend the staff at this location for their performance and skill at making patrons feel both welcome and the focus of attention for their dinning experience. Can't wait to go back!",

Parking: need to go thru the gate and get the ticket, which you can validate at Hangar24 so you don\u2019t need to pay.(it\u2019s right next to cashiers and you do it yourself). It\u2019s a bar where you order at the cashier, they give you a number, you choose where to seat N they will bring the food to you. It\u2019s a great place to hang out with friends.",
      "**Parking:**\n\n- Tricky parking, see videos for guidance.\n\n- Gets busy on weekends so parking is hard to find.\n\n- Free parking if you bring your parking ticket and run it through the machine inside of the bar (no need to buy food or drinks).\n\n**Food and Drinks:**\n\n- I haven\u2019t drunk or dined here, but others I talk to report satisfactory, albeit expensive food and drinks.\n\n- Long lines on weekends.\n\n**Atmosphere**\n\n- Lots of people on weekends so finding a place to sit is hard\n\n- A good place for singles",
      "Great place to go with friends and coworkers. I've been here a few times and the atmosphere is always great. The food is good and the beer selection is too. There's usually a live band playing on weekends also. Parking is easy, with a large parking lot, and there validation inside, so you don't have to pay."

      "I forget how much I enjoy a simple dish that gets elevated. This place is reminds me how a grilled cheese can feel so elegant with good ingredients and good presentation.\n\nThe steak could've been double checked that it was cooked to the requested temperature but it still has great pairings with it.\n\nIf you're looking for a great cocktail and it's mellow enough try to ask Van/Vanessa if she's able to concoct something special but everything on the menu is just as balanced and delicious.",
      "Cozy Pine - it\u2019s weird to have a campground/outdoor themed speakeasy in the middle of a reg restaurant. We walk in and nobody is there and then they lead us to a sliding door revealing a tiny box with about a dozen seats, lots of wood and candles, and picnic benches. It\u2019s super tiny, like a grizzly bear will barely fit in there but it does have the intimate thing going and the drinks were decent.\n\nI wasn\u2019t too hot on the menu but the drinks were done well. There wasnt anything super creative but you\u2019re going for the atmosphere and experience. Yes, prep your IG for the moment.",
      "The ambience alone was definitely the highlight of our visit. The speak-easy, camp theme was well-executed, and I give full credit to the team for their efforts in creating such a unique atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food, while acceptable, was significantly overpriced. We anticipated high prices, so this wasn't a major issue.\n\nWhat really let us down was the service. Despite the restaurant being nearly empty, everything took an unusually long time. The food, however, came out quickly, indicating that the cook was competent and perhaps the only one truly putting in effort.\n\nFurthermore, If they want to stick with the camp theme, they should consider incorporating more camp-related flavors into their menu both drink and food. Additionally, hiring better staff is crucial. The place has great ideas behind it, but it's so poorly run that it seems destined to fail. It\u2019s so close to being a nice place, which is probably what makes me so upset. I'm torn between wishing this place would fail and hoping they improve. I feel bad for the owner and wish them good luck in the future, but we won't be returning.",
      "This place is delicious and has great drinks. Bartenders are all super nice and accommodating to your preferences. New York sour is a huge win here.\n\nFor those people commenting on wait times, context matters.   If the establishment is full, which it normally is on Friday nights, there will be a wait... especially for the speakeasy.   As long as you come in with that understanding you will have a great time.",
      "Excellent place for dinner and date night. My husband and I had a really nice dinner of Chilean Sea Bass and Scallops and Risotto - customer service was amazing - Tony and Kim - thank you for the great service! We had a bottle of Taittinger  Champagne with dinner and we had Tuna Tartare and Beets and Burrata  for appetizers - the food was absolutely delicious! Ray \u2018s has the perfect personality- he is amazing! Wow the new menu is amazing - the steak was done with perfection and as always Nicole and Ray - excellent service !!!!"

Angela does a wonderful job as the bartender and consistently provides wonderful service. She remembers my name, engages in fun and humorous conversation (love her sense of humor). She simply knows what great customer service is and how to deliver it. She genuinely cares about her customers and wants them to have a wonderful experience. My two favorite drinks are a great \"old fashion\" or a classic chilled \"martini\". She makes both well. But even better than the really cold martini she makes, is her kindness and genuine respect for her customers. Thank you Angela for being a consistent reminder of what excellent service should look like.",
      "Food was on point and tasty.. Service has been simply considerate, prompt, and appropriate. Enjoyable period.",

      "My dad wanted to order in for Valentine's Day, so I suggested Mediterranean for a healthier meal. After searching high and low through Door Dash, we decided on Panini Kabob Grill.\n\nWe ordered the family meal for 4 and were concerned it may not be enough because we ordered a family meal from another Mediterranean restaurant before, and it was hardly enough for us. This time, I can honestly say we had more than enough of everything, so much so that we actually had a good amount of meat, salad, and rice leftover, as well as some pita and humus.\n\nThe only thing we did finish was the thin Steak Skewer because we only ordered one of those to try it. It was really juicy and tender. Definitely recommend trying it if you're curious like us.\n\nOverall, we were really happy with our meal. The price came out to about $37 per person, but that's easily for two meals for each of us. We have plenty of leftovers, so tomorrow we will be having those, and I cannot wait! It was all SO good!",
      "Mother in law took my husband and I for lunch. Never knew there was in Irvine. But it was so delicious! Definitely coming back again when we come back to visit. I had the salmon kabob plate.",
      "Beautiful patio lunch with fresh food and outstanding service (thank you Francisco!). Bolognaise linguini had the perfect texture and the sauce held so much flavour. The chicken kabob with bulgar pilaf and romaine avocado salad was my favourite. Portions were large and great bang for buck.",
      "Visited this location for the first time during lunch hour on a Friday. Place was busy. Outside seating was great with the heat lamps. We both ordered the chicken wrap that come with a side of hummus. I got chicken soup as a side and my friends got their Mediterranean salad. Soup arrived cold and the wrap didn\u2019t really have a taste. I looked for salt but there was no salt shaker on the table. So I had to keep dunking the wrap in the hummus to get some taste on the otherwise bland wrap. I expected more given their falafel wraps are juicy and tasty but chicken wrap wasn\u2019t. Disappointing.",
      "Always great food and huge portions for the kabobs here. Come here for lunch and dinner. You won\u2019t be disappointed.  Beef Koobideh Kabob, flat iron, chicken, salmon, and Lamb are all amazing.  Their espresso is great too.\n\nToday I had their breakfast steak/eggs and it was just the right amount."

      "What a great restaurant,  the outside seating was lovely and not too busy during the week. The happy hour lasted all night, so we decided to stay for more drinks! The food was absolutely delicious, and the cocktails were vibrant and fresh. The Mac and Cheese croquet was absolutely amazing. The only downside was that I had to share this with my husband! The mussles were so tasty and not too spicy.  Along with wonderful attentive service, it really was a wonderful last experience in L.A. for us.",
      "Lots of outdoor space and Happy Hour deals through the week that last until about 7 pm (including food and drink options). Not sure exactly when it starts though, but I know they have it on Saturdays as well. The Oysters are pretty good and very juicy. The Spaghetti was in a white sauce topped with large meatballs! Very creamy and pretty different from your normal spaghetti. Overall, service was fine for how busy it was. Cool vibe and very LA!",
      "Tried multiple smaller dishes and everything was delicious. I usually never say that. They also make excellent cocktails, especially the espresso martini. Love the outdoor seating area and the unique decor. Our server Patrick was very attentive and on top of it. My only wish is that they didn\u2019t put a huge obnoxious candle on my tiny dessert slice. A smaller simple birthday candle would have been more appropriate for the size of the dish. I\u2019ll definitely come back to try all the other dishes on the menu.",
      "One of the best dining experiences I had. Our server gave us life in the subtlest way. (I think their name was Kelsey or Kristin.) The drinks were amazing. The appetizers were appetizing. The entrees were divine. Just a fantastic time. The outside dining area was packed and decorated so nicely. As always, we love vegan options in every section of the menu. My only complaint is that I wish they had used Impossible meat instead of Beyond. However, the vegan cheese was delicious.",
      "I\u2019m low-key obsessed with this place and it was my first time. The inside was gorgeous and the stained glass window upstairs with the sun shining through was gorgeous. I wish the piano was being played. The food was amazing and I wanted more. The red sauce that came with the breakfast burrito was so yummy. Kelsey was also great at enhancing our dining experience. She was extremely friendly and made the best suggestions. She was so great at doing her job. Can\u2019t wait to go back and definitely want to have a bday brunch here."

      "Had the Wagyu steak with eggs, cornbread and a mezcal cocktail. The food here is flawless and deliciously so. The restaurant is pretty and so are the servers. There\u2019s a nice patio. I really enjoyed the music. Even the bathrooms are remarkable. Meter parking.",
      "Well hidden location with a quaint and symmetrical atmosphere. I arrived when they opened at 11AM for brunch. I was lucky enough to be one of the only people eating at the time. The steak and eggs. Both of which were absolutely perfect! The steak has the perfect combination of fat and steak for the morning. The sauce was delicious. I spread it across everything. The eggs were a great creamy flavor pair with the steak.  The biggest shock to me qere the potatoes. Usually just a part of the plate that never are considered a highlight. These potatoes were top tier and to me added hearty to the trio. They stole the show. They look like chicken wings. I totslly thought they were.",
      "Been waiting for a while now to go to Norah, and  since the covid restrictions were lifted recently I jumped at the opportunity. We were a bit late to a 8pm reservation but it was okay. The staff were very friendly and asked us what we wanted to drink while we wait for our table: it was very busy for a Friday evening but that\u2019s also probably because restrictions were just lifted.\nThe cocktails were delicious. I tried the passion fruit margarita and the kiwi sour. Both typical cocktails with a nice twist.\nThe food was also very good. You\u2019re meant to share the plates. We got the cornbread which is a must! Make sure to put some of the butter on top. We also got the gnocchi and a pizza.\nIt\u2019s also a really nice atmosphere outside at the back. Make sure to be seated there if you can.\nBe prepared to pay around $80 per person.\nWill definitely be adding this to my favorites in West Hollywood!",
      "Management and staff is knowledgeable and goes out of their way to make sure you have a great dining experience. Enjoyed the unique wine selections and pairings. Great for happy hour or a sophisticated night! Loved the truffle cream pizza..yum!"

It must have been the spinach because I we shared everything else and I didn\u2019t have any problems at all. Probably the spinach/ salad was not washed properly.

She's so welcoming and warm, she's knowledgeable about the menu and proactive about helping you choose the right dish, and she's attentive throughout the meal. She has a great attitude and best of all--she's clearly just being herself! What a gem.\n\nI always love the Granville Salad. It's consistently well seasoned and perfectly dressed.\n\nI also had vanilla ice cream and it was INCREDIBLE!\n\nWe'll be back soon and obviously requesting Lindsay.",
      "Ideally, I'd give it a 3.5/5.\n\nGranville in West Hollywood offers a beautiful dining experience. The indoor space is bright and airy, with skylights and plenty of plants creating a cheerful atmosphere. There's a central bar that adds a touch of energy, and the option for outdoor seating is a plus.\n\nUnfortunately, the service wasn't quite up to par with the ambiance. Our server seemed a little frustrated and even rolled her eyes when we asked questions about the menu.  Having both breakfast and brunch menus to navigate was a bit overwhelming, so some clarification would have been helpful.\n\nThe good news is that the food arrived quickly. We tried the village scramble, skirt steak and eggs, french toast, chai latte, and berry lemonade. The lemonade was a miss - way too sour and unbalanced. The chai latte was just okay.\n\nOn a brighter note, both the village scramble and skirt steak came with delicious roasted potatoes (both sweet and regular), which were perfectly cooked. The sausage in the scramble had a nice kick, and the skirt steak was cooked to a perfect medium, though the portion size was a bit on the small side.\n\nThe french toast was decent, but nothing special. The butter that came with it was good.\n\nOverall, Granville has a lovely atmosphere and some good food options. However, the service needs some improvement, and a couple of dishes fell short.",
      "The food is so tasty. We will definitely be returning. The server and other staff were very friendly and helpful. Loved the vibe of the restaurant and the portion sizes of each dish was very good. We left satisfied and had a little left over. I would recommend to everyone to try this place at least once!",

The Hostess was great and we were seated quickly( had reservation since it was a TSunday around 5)\nOur Server was Fantastic! She was attentive, Friendly , & Helpful with our choices. From the reviews we shared the Trio of tacos( Jackfruit, steak & shrimp) Perfect shareable appetizer! Delicious!\nHubby loves a good burger & this didn't disappoint! It was juicy& good Bun! The fries were jist crispy enough! My Porkchop ( one if my favorite meals to order at a new restaurant) was cooked to perfection! I was pleasantly full. With that said OFCOURSE THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSERT! So, brueleed banana brownie!! YUMM! OH..and the Drinks were Excellent! Very Good Dining Experiencel"

      "We couldn't decide so we ordered everything from the dessert menu.\n\nFAV: Marjolaine Cake and Ube Basque\nCheesecake\n\nOver all, I think each drink and dessert stands to meet very specific cravings and does it really well. It made for a wonderful distinct tasting experience.\n\nMarjolaine Cake was a multi layered multi textured experience with beautiful plating. cutting through the top layer was a struggle and crushed the layers below at the slice but the taste was impeccable. It reminded us of our best tiramisu experiences.\n\nUbe cheesecake was just good, beautiful deep flavors and colors. So if you want ube and cheesecake this is the perfect merge of flavors and experience without overpowering each other. We also enjoyed that it wasn't overly sweetened and complimented by a sorta sour cream spread.\n\nThe Spikey Lemon with crunchy meringue was also a contender. It was soft, light, melts in your mouth and bursting with lemony flavor with a satisfying meringue crunch. The shape was so quirky and fun. By the look of it, you know exactly what you're gonna get from the bite\n\nThe souffl\u00e9 was well executed. It was a rich dark chocolate souffl\u00e9 experience. It wasn't the most exciting on the list but if I was craving chocolate that would have been my pick.\n\nThe halo halo was interesting, it was an elevated and renewed experience of the original street filipino desert that my filipino fam is very familiar with. It was a fun twist. But it's quite unexpected and has mixed reviews for people who don't have any familiarity with the desert.\n\nService was wonderful, our server gave us wonderful drink recommendations. I liked the white pearl the most, it did have a lovely and noticeable ginger bite that helped me pace my sips.\n\nEven as the kitchen and bar closed the staff left us undisturbed and allowed us to linger and finish at our leisure. The late night vibes at the roof top were just five stars! What a luxurious experience to taste the night away overlooking city lights. Inspiring!",

      "The views were stellar. The ambience and noise were perfect and the drinks were amazing. Watching the sunset while dining on the whole fish entree was everything.  I can't wait to go back!",
      "This place is really cool! On a Tuesday night, the crowd was mostly subdued, and atmosphere was mellow. The decor and lighting allow for a relaxing and delicious night to begin. Which brings me to the food, which was quite wonderful!! Not one dish was below perfect, and the presentations were absolutely gorgeous. I\u2019m talking Michelin-star presentations, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Merois earns a Michelin star. Coupled with a decent city skyline view\u2026. I have to say I certainly recommend Merois! 5 stars!"

      "Went for a birthday celebration and we were not disappointed. 4 of us (and one dog) were welcomed to the expanded outside patio. Very well laid out and not at all crowded. The nosie level outside is also nice. We had a variety of dishes and all were wonderful, starting with the avocado and chickpea dip. It came in a huge silver champagne bucket full of a wide variety of vegetables. We also ordered the fennel pizza. Big pieces of well seasoned sausage on a wonderful and well baked dough. Very tasty sauce too. Four entr\u00e9es were ordered  - butter lettuce salad, cavatelli lamb ragu, rigatoni bolognese and fusilli pesto. Of course we all had to taste and share each one. Subtle salad with light dressing, tasty lamb in a wonderful ragu, traditional bolognese with a lot of beef (although I do prefer a mixutre of beef and sausage) and a subtle pesto dish that was not overpowering. Of course a fine wine by the glass and bottle selection too. The drinks are great and well mixed, including the non alcoholic ones. Since it was a birthday, they presented us a profiterole with salted caramel gelato complete with a candle. They never rushed us and it was a wonderful relaxing time. Definitely worrh a return visit. Valet and metered street parking.",
      "Loved this restaurant. The staff were amazing and every dish was great. It was very flavorful, warm, and just overall delicious. We were celebrating 2 birthdays and they brought out a salted caramel dessert on the house!",
      "I regret not trying this place sooner because after dinner last night, I would say this is definitely in my top five favorite Italian restaurants in LA list. It\u2019s in a really busy and fun part of town. This part of West Hollywood is not as busy as the North end so parking isn\u2019t as bad but it\u2019s still difficult at certain times. We were able to find a metered street spot right out front, but we were just lucky with the timing. Otherwise it will be $15 for valet. I especially love how the inside is designed. It has a classy 1920s feel to it and I especially love how dark it is inside, and how each table has its own lighting. It really adds to the mood. They also have a very large and busy bar that had every seat taken during our entire meal. Our server was very polite and all of our items came out quickly after placing the order.\n\nThey have a fairly large menu with a lot of great options on it. The hardest part for me was narrowing down which ones I wanted to order because there were so many that I wanted to get. I started off with the Whipped Ricotta and thought it was fantastic. It\u2019s a really sweet and cheesy start to the meal. Next was the Fried Artichokes and honestly they were some of the best that I\u2019ve ever had. First off, you can eat the entire thing and secondly, the flavors were just terrific. Next came the Steak Tartare and I thought it was wonderful. The black truffle really adds to the flavor and I especially loved the quail egg. For our entr\u00e9es, we chose the Butternut Squash Tortellini and the Lamb Ragu Cavatelli. Both were good sized portions and were cooked perfectly. The flavors were just very rich and we enjoyed every bite. They did have some good dessert options but by this time of meal, we were just too full.\n\nOverall one of my favorite Italian restaurants in all of Los Angeles. I definitely would recommend to anyone for any occasion, and I plan to be back in the future.",
      "I loved the place, I didn\u2019t have a reservation so I took a seat at the bar and ordered a drink of Hennessy on the rocks. The service is fantastic! They are all very attentive and warm. It is obvious that I will be back.",
      "Fair review - one of the most delicious Italian restaurant in that area\nBeef tartare was amazing\nGrilled octopus - one love!\nCauliflower supposed to be grilled but it was more like boiled, but still good.\nArtichokes unusual and also delicious.\nDidn\u2019t try any meet this time but I will come back here soon."

Also had the Carlitos way cocktail which is so fire. It comes in a mason jar with no ice but they give you a side glass off ice to pour the drink into. The breakfast pizza was so good and a unique take on breakfast. I highly recommend this place everything is perfect. They do a great job.",

Highly recommend for a date spot, I had a lovely evening.",
      "This place is pretty dope for brunch. Love the location (on Sunset), I love the atmosphere, everyone was super friendly and attentive. The food was good, drinks were potent (\u2665\ufe0f), and just a super chill place. Good, relaxing music played in the background. The price was too bad either. I went with a party of three. We all had 1-2 drinks a piece, ordered 1-2 food items and it came out to $133 (tip not included) and that\u2019s pretty fair. No to mention, they don\u2019t try to rush you out when you just want to chat a bit with your friends (which is really important to me. I don\u2019t like feeling rushed especially if I\u2019m enjoying myself). I guess I was really drawn my the color scheme. I love blues. It\u2019s trendy. It\u2019s casual. It can be a bit upscale but not intimidating. I\u2019ll totally come back for dinner. I bet it\u2019s gorgeous at night being on the back patio.",
      "Place is great. Johnny the bartender is fantastic. See my pics. Atmosphere is fun",
      "Small intimate indoor rustic vibe, large outdoor patio seating. Friendly service,  valet parking only."

      "What a lovely dining experience. Hunter was a great server and took care of us, recommending things and being generally ebullient. The food was delicious and I would absolutely recommend the miso salmon, cooked perfectly. The bite of the night, though, was the Brussel sprouts with kimchi paste and golden raisins. Next level!\n\nAlso, clean bathrooms with Aesop soap\u2014LA baby!",

Lovely combination you cannot resist.",
      "We loved our waitress Noemi \ud83d\udc95 she was very kind and attentive to all her tables.\nFood is excellent!! Deff get the rigatoni! The steak was also very good, medium rare was better cooked than Craig\u2019s for sure. I also recommend having the orange wine \ud83d\ude17\ud83d\udc4cThanks for the lovely vibes and food x",
      "A popular place for girls brunch.\nI love there heaters! So warm that I would take my jackets off even on a rainy cold Sunday :)\n\nService is great and the ambiance is perfect.\nI would with they have a new brunch menu tho:)\n\nRecommended.",
      "Everyone has their own biases. Mine is having a deep appreciation for restaurants whose full kitchen stays open later than most of their peers on any given night. It's with that in mind that Ysabel hold a special place in my heart.\n\nHaving grabbed a seat at the bar at 10:30pm on a Wednesday, you can imagine the sheer joy at being able to choose from the full menu. I went with the The shrimp and salmon and neither disappointed.\n\nDid I mention that Ysabel is beautiful. With an array of indoor and outdoor dining experiences, Ysabel\u00a0has the flexibility to be ideal for anything from social to professional."

      "Been here a couple of times! Very accurate with reservations, accommodating our group of 7. Excellent service and food is a hit each time. I highly recommend the hummus trio app and the avocado burrata toast was amaaaazing! They also have great salads and sandwiches, and make a great Aperol spritz. As usual, I can\u2019t wait to come back!",
      "Lovely seating in the back patio, but a bit of a hike to the restroom.  Service was good  . The food didn't knock my socks off but it was good ( carbanara spaghetti) The specialty drink was tasty.",
      "This is by far my favorite restaurant in LA. The quality of food is fresh and so delicious! I love the vibe, the staff are super friendly, and you just feel like you\u2019re entering a magical place. It\u2019s a special little corner of LA and I highly recommend it.\n\nTheir cream of mushroom soup is incredible, the sweet potatoes fries, the m\u00e1gico mushroom pasta and honestly everything is just tasty!",
      "Beautiful restaurant. The food is delicious and the service was impeccable. Blown away by the happy hour quiche bites (didn\u2019t realize that is what quiche should taste like). Also tried the shrimp salad, the mac and cheese and the crepe suzette. All absolutely marvellous. AND I was with my friend from France who was very impressed. Highly recommend!"

      "All vegan! All organic! Meatless Mexican cuisine that is so full of flavor it can please the pickiest of eaters. This restaurant is pretty much the epitome of what I think of for LA vegan food at its finest. What makes it even better is that they have Happy Hour too! Weekdays 3 to 6 pm that includes both food and drinks! The space is very chic and very LA. Service was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, give it a try if you want to get more vegan goodness in your life!",
      "We enjoyed an incredible late lunch here.  We started with the nachos, they were devoured!!  Between the 6 of us we tried nearly every menu item!!  Nobody was disappointed!  We would never seek out a vegan restaurant, but the flavours and combinations were incredible.  The cocktails were good.",
      "Amazing vegan place! All the items on the menu are absolutely gems. We love weekend brunch there. The patio is lovely and perfect for LA weather. Also don't underestimate and skip the vegan desserts. They are amazing.",
      "Had a phenomenal time at the Drag Brunch this past Sunday! So awesome that Gracias Madre supports the community in this way.\n\nOur server, Katia, was FANTASTIC.\n\nThe food is always a hit or miss for me. I didn't love the Cazuela Calabacitas (a frittata)--it lacked seasoning. And the black beans that came with it were pretty al dente. I prefer mine cooked thoroughly (I'll remember to ask for this next time if whatever dish I order comes with black beans).\n\nI had a bite of the mushroom quesadilla and it was SO GOOD. Also loved the nachos. My friend loved her Crepas Mexicanas.\n\nKatia also brought a comped dessert for our friend whose birthday we were celebrating. Love that touch.\n\nTheir patio is just lovely.\n\nWe'll be back, obviously!",
      "The service was nice but way too fast We didn\u2019t even have the time to finish our starters that they already filled the table with the main dishes. I wish the guacamole and ceviche were fresher. As soon as we finished our last bite, the check was brought. Well 45min and we were out"

      "Let me start off by saying Jessica is the greatest waitress. Over the past few years I\u2019ve come in regularly and I have nothing short of a perfect experience when she takes care of my table. The food is also amazing. Normally I like to stick to what I know, but lately I\u2019ve been trying different dishes and nothing has disappointed. The photos I have from previous meals are mainly brunch, but they also have a delicious lasagna and the desserts are 1000/10.",
      "Don't go for a meal. Disappointing. Overall it was an ok experience - because the atmosphere and pastries. But definitely not great. The food was not great. The service was friendly, but really lacking and got several things wrong!\n\nMy matcha was warm. Not hot. I had the eggs benedicts with hash browns instead of the English muffin. The hash browns were greasy, swimming in grease. I would not order them again. My friend ordered a side of eggs with her souffle pancake, but these were forgotten. The busser noted it on the ticket and said oh I see that you ordered eggs. How would you like them? So they arrived several minutes after the table was served. Another friend had toast, but didn't get jam, butter or anything at all to put on her toast. She had to flag someone down because the server did not check back after our food was delivered. The server never check on us. After we had completely finished our meal, and drinks, including water, the server did eventually come back and offer another round of drinks. But we were already finished eating. We all wanted to order another round of drinks but no one checked on us until we were completely done eating. He did bring us water while we waited for the check, which also took surprisingly long. If you're a thirsty girl you might wanna bring your own water bottle. My macaron was delicious. The restroom was very clean and well attended to. The pastry case is beautiful, vast, worth the visit, and should be explored.",
      "We went to the Bottega Louie in West Hollywood for dessert after dinner. They have so many cakes and desserts. I have difficulty deciding because they all look delicious and I wanted them all! Lol\n\nWe decided to dine in and ordered a few items. The customer service is excellent. Our waitperson is very polite and attentive. The desserts are so good. I wish I could eat more!",
      "Gorgeous space. Well designed, beautiful pastry displays. Aesthetics 10/10.\n\nService does not match the atmosphere. Our server was fine but quite indifferent, clearly there for a paycheque. Waters & empty cocktails were not paid any mind. After eating, we went to order a beignet from the counter and the server or manager there was very short with us and squished the beignet\u2019s to fit in the box instead of choosing another packaging option.\n\nThe food was well made, very flavourful, definitely matches the vibe.",
      "Very West Hollywood when it comes to a meal.\n\nThe lunch menu offers a variety of options, catering to different tastes. Chicken parmesan is a true standout. Tender chicken breast, breaded and fried to a golden crisp, is smothered in marinara sauce and melted mozzarella. The pizza is a slice of heaven. The thin crust is perfectly crispy, and the toppings are fresh and flavorful.\n\nThe pastries, especially the macarons did not disappoint. Vibrant colors, delicate shells, and a variety of flavors\u2014each bite was a little piece of heaven. The chocolate \u00e9clair was another winner, filled with velvety custard and topped with glossy chocolate ganache. And don\u2019t miss croissants \ud83e\udd50\n\nWhile the price is not the most budget-friendly option, the quality of food and service justifies the cost."

      "I recently dined at Amour Restaurant in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, and it was an unforgettable experience. The restaurant beautifully blends French cuisine with a Japanese touch, creating a unique and delightful menu. Each dish was a masterpiece, with flavors that were both sophisticated and innovative.\n\nThe ambiance is incredibly romantic, perfect for a special night out. The dim lighting, elegant decor, and soft music set the perfect mood for an intimate dining experience. Moreover, the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, making us feel welcome and well cared for throughout the evening.\n\nWhether you're celebrating a special occasion or just looking for an extraordinary meal, Amour Restaurant is a must-visit. Highly recommended!",
      "I came here with a group of friends a few weeks ago and WOW. I was so impressed.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is BEAUTIFUL. Extremely well designed space, down to the cutlery and accents on the table.\n\nService was lovely! Very friendly and I loved their uniforms, just adds to the space in general.\n\nAnd now\u2026 THE FOOD. Let me lead with the fact that I\u2019m vegan. I\u2019ll be honest, I was not expecting much because this is a French restaurant and historically, these are restaurants I typically get a salad with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar and side of bread. Well\u2026 the bread is delicious. BUT I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they can modify their vegetarian tasting menu to be FULLY VEGAN. And wow did they commit. Every single dish I had that evening was full of flavor, innovation, and creativity. I had a few favorites\u2014 the beet tartar & the kohlrabi steak with sun choke chips are still on my mind.\n\nOverall this was a GREAT experience. If you\u2019re vegan you will be taken care of. If you\u2019ve got vegan friends, they will not feel left out of the experience.",
      "This place is very cute & romantic. It was a very busy night and service was a little slow but tolerable. Unique dishes on the menu which was fun to see. The endive & fennel salad were our favorites. The lobster pasta was too salty and the very expensive sole lacked flavor. The chocolate mousse was lovely. They serve Soju & wine presently. Liquor license in the works. Only 2 bathrooms and really in the worse spot.. right in front of the kitchen. As people were waiting in line, the poor staff had to maneuver around them. There was a health fee on the bill but we asked for it to be removed and it was. Would like to come back for the summer.. their outdoor dining looks nice.",
      "I recently dined at Amour, a charming French restaurant, and it was an absolute delight. From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance transported me to the streets of Paris. Quentin, our server, provided impeccable service with a genuine smile and excellent recommendations. The food was exquisite and beautifully presented. The attention to detail in both the cuisine and the service truly made our dining experience memorable. I highly recommend Amour to anyone seeking an enchanting taste of France.",
      "Such an amazing experience from the service to the food to the beautifully decorated atmosphere! Feels like you were transported into france. This was hands down one of the best meals I have had in LA. Ordered the steak tartar, carpaccio, lobster tagliatelle, and cheesecake and everything was DELICIOUS. I even got to meet the chef behind these amazing dishes! 10/10 come here for a great dining experience!"

      "We ordered CLUB SANDWICH (vegan) and Cinnamon swirl French toast. The sandwich was okay. I felt the flavors were less in the tofu. However, the French toast was yummy. I would go here again for the French toast.\n\nGiven the price, I didn't find the food taste worth it, however, the portion size is huge.\n\nThe service and the ambiance were good.",
      "there is no gluten in this restaurant all the bread covered items on the menu are gluten free. you are going to pay for it but it's tasty, I took these photos offline because I forgot to take my own, but we (4 of us) shared nachos, chili fries, and fried chicken plate",
      "Absolutely loved Hugo's! We went twice for breakfast and almost grabbed dinner too. Everything was incredible, especially for those with dietary restrictions. My wife has gluten intolerance, and they could make everything gluten-free! It wasn't just your basic eggs and bacon either - they had creative, chef-quality dishes. She loved the gluten-free cinnamon swirl French toast so much we asked if the bread was made in-house (it was!), and they even let us buy a loaf to take home!\nLoved the classic architecture arches and stained glass also."

      "I recently visited Le Petit Four and I must say, it's one of the best French restaurants I've experienced in Los Angeles. The owner was incredibly welcoming and friendly, adding a personal touch to our dining experience. We started with the snails, which were superb, followed by a Quiche Lorraine and Salade Ni\u00e7oise for the entr\u00e9es. Each dish was simply incredible, perfectly capturing the essence of French cuisine. The ambiance of the restaurant enhances the authentic French vibe, making it a must-visit for anyone in search of genuine French dining. I absolutely recommend Le Petit Four if you're looking for a top-notch French restaurant experience.",
      "One of my favorite restaurants in LA. So French, and so Fun. You will feel like you are in France without having to shell out for the airfare.  Great people watching on the fabled Sunset Plaza. Parking is abundant in the huge lot just below Sunset Blvd. Incredible al fresco dining, minus the occasional noisemaker car (again, Why?) But the festive chatter of your dining neighbors is enough to make it a dreamy and romantic experience.\n\nAlex and his incredibly hardworking and gracious staff make you feel so at home and well taken care of.  The menu is incredibly varied and always excellent. I've never been disappointed by a single dish and I try different meals when I am there.  Enough choices to satisfy everyone in your party.\n\nThis landmark is an LA Treasure! Get here while you can. The greatest places here can vanish.  Enjoy! Voila! Merci! XOXOX",
      "The Calamari Steak is incredible. One of the best calamari dishes I've had in a long time. I ordered this dish as an appetizer and it was perfect to share with a few people.\n\nThe pizza wasn't bad, you're probably better off ordering a pizza from an Italian restaurant instead. Same goes with the pasta.\n\nI was really upset with the Penne Le Petit Four. It was a bit too sweet, I was served this dish without parmesan cheese.\n\nThe environment is great, the parking is easy, and this is a great place to go for some french food.",
      "This lunch was the highlight of our short time in LA. I still think about these crab cakes - they are a must. They were soft, fresh, and paired perfectly with both creamy dips. The service was lovely. We were given options about where to be seated: patio or indoors. For dessert, our server brought out a cake tray with the day\u2019s freshly baked options. The napoleon was so satisfying. All in all happy with everything we ordered and would certainly be back again.",
      "Great dinner while visiting WeHo! Hostest was great, also when I had questions about the desserts she brought the whole platter for me to see the assortment. Also, very much appreciated  was the fact they are all made fresh in house! Highly recommend!"

It\u2019s beautiful and has a koi pond nearby and the service was excellent and the wait staff were extremely attentive.\nGoing to the food, the prime rib and chips were excellent !\nHowever the cod and burrata were slightly below average, the cod was rubbery and the burrata was bland (despite the pesto pea spread).\nThe drink was slightly unbalanced for me , too much fennel / bitterness and lemon. But I understand that is subjective.\nAll in all, lovely experience especially if you\u2019re staying at the sunset marquis.",

No matter what  request we threw at them. I cannot wait to return to the property, and this restaurant.",

We also got a side of Chicken Sausage that were pretty dry. Drinks are good up here and enjoyed the non-alcoholic Eye Opener shot which will perk you up!

Hostess sat us within minutes of our  arrival. We got sat at a table that was a little cramped but turned out the seating was full with other amazing people like us.  Ended making friends with the surrounding tables. \u201cExtra bonus that was\u201d. Then  we were greeted with more friendly staff that gave us first timers run down on food specials and drinks.

      "Having explored every nook and cranny of Italy, I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a restaurant in Hollywood, CA  that exudes authenticity and purity. The pasta served here easily ranks among the top three I've ever tasted in my entire life. As for the Ossobuco, it surpasses any previous encounter I've had with this dish, leaving an indelible mark on my taste buds. Each plate presented an exquisite blend of textures and an unrivaled richness that truly elevated the dining experience to stellar heights. The desserts, oh, the desserts! They were a sinful indulgence, transporting me to a realm of pure bliss. The drinks, meticulously crafted, were nothing short of perfection. The service and hospitality bestowed upon us were unparalleled, with every detail attended to by the attentive and genuinely sincere staff. To my astonishment, the owners themselves graced our table, ensuring our utmost satisfaction. This remarkable establishment deserves not just five or even a hundred stars, but a staggering 10,000 stars.",
      "The food and service at this restaurant are exceptional. I highly recommend this beautiful establishment. Their gnocchi is delectable, and their margherita pizza, though not on the menu (just ask for it), is simply divine. The cocktails are top-notch, and the napoleon cake is the best I've ever tasted.",
      "The Best Italian restaurant in the City \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\nFamily owned and operated with a stacked menu that anyone with taste buds can appreciate. This treat does not come cheap\u2026 you\u2019ll need to have deep pockets to enjoy this meal or save up because it\u2019s worth it! But be ready for a hefty bill and make sure you save room for the most decadent mouthwatering desserts. Madeo\u2019s is an authentic Italian top tier Restaurant, one of the cities leading and most renowned celebrity filled dining establishments. Highly recommended and loved by all who have had the pleasure to experience it  \ud83e\udd70 Thank you for treating all of us like your familia Madeo!\ud83c\udf5d\u2764\ufe0f",
      "My favourite restaurant in LA - without a doubt! I almost don\u2019t want to post about it as I don\u2019t want more people to find out about it (it\u2019s already hard enough to get a table there as is\u2026) but it is one of the few in West LA that is worth the price you pay. Everything tastes exquisite. The service is exceptional. The ambience is impeccable. It somehow combines both the intimacy of a family-run place (which it is) with the elegance of this type of environment carries. The owner comes out to greet you every night. Birthdays, graduations, visitors in town\u2026 this is always where I take them. I highly recommend the penne Madeo, risotto and millefeuille.",
      "The food was great but the constant looks and whispers in our direction from our waitress and other staff members  made the whole night very uncomfortable for myself and coworkers. We felt very judged and talked about. I would understand if someone was being loud or out of line but that was not the case. The staff should learn not to turn up their noses at people bc our money is just as green as theirs. They should remember they are an employee not a patron. We may have been scouting this location to bring clients to but that is out of the question now!"

      "Stellar bottomless brunch on the weekends, it lasts till 5 pm Saturdays & Sundays! And it is bottomless in every way\u2026food and drink. A luxury, since I hark from Boston where this is a rare sight :) Lovely presentation for each dish and the dining area is tucked away in the hotel, so it\u2019s one of the most peaceful & quiet  brunching experiences I\u2019ve had!",
      "This is truly a hidden gem!!! I went for brunch and everything from food presentation to taste was amazing! The bottomless brunch was 100% worth it and great value for the price! The staff was so attentive and friendly especially Matthew. I will definitely come back when I visit LA again!",
      "The Most beautiful Brunch rooftop. Came with my mom on mother's day and we enjoyed it so much. There were plenty of options to choose from. I'm vegan and they gave me a burger and a cauliflower steak. The staff is extremely nice and friendly. We will definitely be back. The rooftop views are beautiful and there are plenty of umbrellas\u2602\ufe0f Take an Uber you will drink a lot of mimosas/ Bellinis\ud83e\udd17",
      "One of the best hidden restaurants in LA because it\u2019s in the London hotel but it\u2019s truly exceptional. Highly recommend going here even if you\u2019re not staying at the hotel. I\u2019ve prob ate here 50 times and have never had a bad meal.",
      "Highly recommended! Took my son here for his birthday as he had been banging on about eating Gordan Ramsey\u2019s food after watching too much Hells Kitchen. The dishes are pricey but that\u2019s to be expected for a $$$ restaurant. The potion is good as you can see from the photos and you will be full. The menu does change but you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nThe atmosphere was ambient and chill. Our server was French which added some authentication to it serving British/European dishes. The restaurant is inside of the hotel so be careful with your Uber if they don\u2019t go into the hotel driveway. Best to stand on the main road to avoid your Uber trying to leave so quickly and charge you."

      "We recently went to Tesse and tried their DineLA menu which was $55 per person for dinner.\n\nWe ordered a couple of blue cheese  martini's which were quite small for $32 each and took forever to come out because they were short-staffed that evening.  I can't even imagine how small the martini on their specialty menu is which was described as \"tiny\" and even smaller than the ones we got.\n\nFor the 1st course we got the poblano beignets which came with 4 absolutely delicious pieces.  10/10.\n\nFor the 2nd course we got the beef tartare which was also amazing.  It was a small portion but still a satisfying amount.  It came covered in potato chips which we used to scoop it up. 10/10\n\nThe 3rd course was the bone marrow bucatini which would have been much tastier if it came out warm but it didn't. I can tell it would have been pretty tasty though but the coldness kind of killed it.   7/10.\n\nThe 4th course was black cod which was pretty bland and disappointing.  It was a bit soupy and came with summer squash and zucchini which was also boring, 2/10.  We got the duck fat fries as the side which were nothing special.  They would have been better if they were crispier, 7/10.\n\nWe love onion rings and though these were not part of the DineLA menu we decided to order them and they did not disappoint.   They were battered exactly how we like them. 9/10.\n\nThe desert was sticky toffee pudding which was, unfortunately, a let-down.  The cake portion tasted burnt.   The only thing that made it edible was the toffee syrup and scoop of ice cream but the scoop was too small. 5/10\n\nOverall, I think this restaurant was overpriced for what we got.  Maybe doing the DineLA menu was a mistake.  The meal climaxed way too early.   I don't think we would go back.",
      "Some of the food was delicious some was disgusting the pancakes burnt, the hash/rib/egg is a really bad combo uneatable Truffle fries and avocado toast are good! Our waitress Itzel was rude and highly unprofessional and they were understaffed or something. I had to ask twice for water when we were under 100+ degrees today Asked for bread came way too late and they had the nerve to charge me $10 for a piece of bread that arrived after we finished eating!! I didn\u2019t even need it anymore Each time we needed something we had to wait for at least 15-25minutes!!! No paper towel in the bathrooms",
      "Delicious food and cocktails. We were impressed by the marrow pasta and all the cocktails we got. The service was great, and it was lovely talking to the sommelier lady. The atmosphere was great with live music that was just the right volume to create a romantic setting without being disruptive. The friendly host knew we had a show to attend after our dinner and even checked-in on us at some point to see if we were doing good on time.",
      "We had an absolutely incredible time during our first experience at Tesse! Wow! From the exceptional food to the epic service\u2026 we were totally blown away. It was one of the best meals we have ever had and will definitely be back. The all you can tesse experience was one for the books. Wow! Special shout out to Alicia, Blithe and Alexandra for amazing service. Highly recommend this incredible restaurant for any occasion.",
      "Had a Father's Day Brunch! The Rib Hash was a real winner, along with the Benedict. The star of the show was the melt-in-your-mouth French Toast!"

      "Had a lovely time at Olivetta. This was our second time at this restaurant and it was just as tasty as the first time. Definitely go here later in the day if you care about the vibes, the dim lighting is much more suited to this restaurant than the amount of light let in through the skylight during the day. The food is fantastic, I had the branzino and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned and my girlfriend got the bone marrow pasta and said that that dish is the reason why we will keep coming back. The non alcoholic cocktails were also delightful.",
      "We booked Olivetta for an early Valentine\u2019s Day dinner, based on its popularity and reputation. I would not classify it as fine dining, more so a really good Italian restaurant that specializes in drinks, and a more upscale and lively vibe versus a traditional fine dining restaurant like Madeo up on W Sunset. I would say it\u2019s a great place to bring a date or dinner with friends or family, and not so much a work dinner location. The inside is beautifully done and has some great colors. There are tapestries all along the walls with lots of plants dividing the dining areas and a very muted red color that really adds to the ambience. They don\u2019t have a dedicated parking lot, it will be valet or metered street parking. You have to check in with security street side first and then they let you walk up the ramp where you will next check in with the hostess. They have a large bar area as well as a lot of different seating options. Our table was extremely small, however, and the tables were very close together so this is not the sort of place that you\u2019ll be able to have a private or sensitive conversation. Our server was very polite, although took quite some time to take our order initially but overall, I think he did a great job. The music is quite loud here so if someone has hearing issues they will really struggle to hear others at their table.\n\nThey have a fairly large menu with a lot of great options on it. We started off with a Squash Blossoms, which were absolutely fantastic. I have ordered these all over town and this is definitely one of the better versions. I was a bit disappointed that it only comes with three which is a hard number to share so I wish the portion size would\u2019ve been a bit larger for this. Next we followed with the Caesar Salad and it was great. Again, not a very large sized portion, but still tasty flavorwise. For my entr\u00e9e, I chose the Creste Di Gallo because having the bone marrow scooped in right before you eat is an unbeatable addition to me. It was a true treat. I love bone marrow anything so this was great pasta. The bone marrow itself added a great flavor and a crunch to the meal, which I truly loved. We also ordered the special for the day, which was the Dungeness Crab Tagliatelle. It was absolutely fantastic and had a ton of crab on it. The sauce was truly what made the dish and the pasta was cooked perfectly. For dessert we topped off the meal with the Brown Sugar Budino and I definitely would recommend it. It was sweet and salty and actually a great sized portion. it was a great end of the meal.\n\nOverall, I would say Olivetta is a great date spot. It\u2019s very lively and very noisy but in a fun way. They play the music quite loud so it has a very Friday night kind of feel to it. I would recommend and will try it again sometime in the near future.",
      "Celebrated my anniversary here yesterday and hands down this can be my favorite go to. The ambiance so was romantic and European. We walked in and they gave us Champaign on the house because we were celebrating our anniversary which was nice. The waitress was beyond helpful. Whatever she recommended is what we got and wow 10/10. For cocktails i had the tequila + carrot which sounded weird but I gave it a shot and it was amazing! The crispy squash blossom was so delicious!!! My favorite thing on the menu. We also had the shaved fennel salad which was very good and refreshing. My husband had the Radiatore which is a lamb bolognese, we were skeptical about ordering that dish because it might be very over powering with lamb but the waitress told us its half lamb and half beef so we gave it a try and it was DELICIOUS!Must try! I definitely recommend this restaurant.",
      "Californian upscale dining in WeHo. Made a reservation for 6:30pm online beforehand but we had to be seated a bit late since traffic is atrocious. Metered street parking and valet parking available. Indoor dining only. Credit cards accepted. We were a bit apprehensive about how the dining experience would be given the other negative reviews lambasting the service, but everyone was so pleasant. Our waiter checked in on us often and we always had a full glass of water.\n\nWe had the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta (3) and baked prawns (4) to split as apps. I got the raviolo from their truffle menu; it was the first time I had such a giant stuffed pasta and this is also what made me realize ravioli is the plural form of the word. My sister got the bone marrow pasta which they cut and topped right before serving, and my dad got the lobster bucatini. The bucatini was fresh and cooked al dente. For dessert, we ended with the chocolate ball. I was unfortunate to have missed the melting of the ball since I was in the restroom but the dessert itself was tasty.",
      "Enjoyed our night out at Olivetta, a sophisticated venue with interesting decor and artwork. Highlights included the branzino combined with the fennel salad. Great cocktails too."

We tried the single and double burger with everything on it, both were great and had that smash burger quality (nice and crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside).\n\nWe practically inhaled those burgers and the fries were so good, we got both the chilli cheese fries and the regular fries. They tasted great, nothing revolutionary or unheard of, just delicious. And this was all to go, unfortunately parking was abysmal. Be prepared to look.",

Irv's is often on the top or near the top of many burger lists. My biggest burger regret is that it took me a long time to actually go and try them out. They've been open and serving their amazing burgers for a long time.\n\nThe burger was fantastic. It was high quality beef, meaty with a lot of flavor and expertly cooked. The cheese was melty and balanced the beefy flavors. I always like getting a burger the way the restaurant recommends it, and their style is a classic combo.\n\nI think the Irv's sauce is based on Thousand Island dressing. It was perfect.\n\nThey go with crispy, thin fries, and they serve a big basket. Of course I ate everything I ordered. How could I not when everything is this good!\n\nI went on a Sunday and found street parking.

Ambiance and Aesthetics: Laurel Hardware boasts a lively and well-designed ambiance. The crowd, food, and drinks create an amazing aesthetic that sets the tone for a memorable dining experience.\n\n2. Cocktails: The drinks here are top-notch! Whether you're sipping on refreshing cocktails or memorable margaritas, it's a great way to kick off any celebration.\n\n3. Food: While some dishes were merely okay, others were outstanding. We highly recommend trying the truffle fries, sticky pork ribs, and duck fried rice.",
      "This place is AMAZING. Came with a group of four and ordered a bunch of things off the menu to share family style, and everything was excellent, including drinks. It's a little pricey, but that's expected for the area and ambiance. My only complaint is that apparently all of their fried foods share the same oil so my wife wasn't able to have any fried foods because she's allergic to shellfish and they fry everything, including shellfish, in the same oil. Seems a bit dangerous to me, but I'm happy we were asked about allergies, and this was disclosed to us by our server.\nI'd definitely come again.",
      "Tried out Laurel Hardware with a friend while we visited the area. Food overall was tasty and the atmosphere inside was interesting. Service was fine and the drinks were above average. Overall the vibes were a tad pretentious for what you get, but it's a good dinner option.",
      "Came here for lunch for the first time and had a wonderful server named Allison. She was very attentive and gave great service. The shrimp tacos are a must. The food is perfect for sharing and everything tastes fresh and flavorful. Definitely one of my go to spots in LA.",
      "Absolutely outstanding food, service and drinks!  Very accommodating as my son was so happy to be wearing his Mario hat from Universal and the staff made him smile with compliments.  The drinks are top notch and unlike many places where  only a certain dish is excellent this establishment has it all!  Everything we ordered was absolutely fantastic!  Unlocking DFW Communities will definitely feature it in a future video!"

      "As you walk through the large velvet curtains, you enter into a barn-like wooden structure with all sorts of western memorabilia, signs, saddles, and the like. Saddle Ranch is a fun and boisteeous country-themed old west bar located in West Hollywood. Exemplary table service but sitting at the bar can be entertaining on its own. Take a spin on the mechanical bull ($5), which was on the low setting during our visit. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nThe many, many TV screens play a never-ending selection of great old 80s and 90s music videos, which were fun to watch.\n\nFood was inexpensive and most dishes were very ample; lots of drink choices. Our neighboring table ordered the mountainous cotton candy martini, which was visually amazing. The large valet parking lot is $10.",
      "This is a West Hollywood staple. You absolutely must come. Food is great. Vibe is even better. You can make reservations on OpenTable. I do recommend. It\u2019s gets very busy after 8pm. Bar is open seating.\n\nWe ended up sitting at the bar, even though we had a reservation. We just loved the bartenders and were having too much fun to move to a table. It was a great decision.\n\nOur service was quick and very accurate. Both bartenders were nothing other than professional. They were really on it with customers who came in over served. It was really cool to watch how the bartenders had full control of their bar and the experience the patrons were having. Absolutely outstanding.\n\nWe ordered the mound of nachos. So good. A ton of food. Could feed four. We got the mini burgers. Also great. We got tots instead of fries. Sooo good. We got the banana bread pudding for dessert. Perfect sweet treat to wrap up the meal with.\n\nI can\u2019t say enough great things about Saddle Ranch. I\u2019ve been coming for over 15 years now. Thank You for always delivering!",

      "We went for dinner around midnight. It's great they serve food so late!\n\nThe staff was very polite and friendly and they kept checking if we needed something else.\n\nWe had the burger and the tacos and they were both decent.\n\nInside it was too loud for me, so we sat outside. It had heaters so the temperature was good.\n\nDefinetely recommend for a late night dinner.",

      "My husband got us a reservation since we were in town for vacation. The service and atmosphere were great. The food was just okay. I had the short ribs, they were very tender but bland. The calamari were fried to perfection. Chicken Parmigiana, Lobster Diavolo, and Salmon were just okay. The margarita I make at home tastes a lot better than the one I had at the restaurant. I only took a few sips and didn\u2019t drink the rest.\nI definitely expected better since it\u2019s a popular restaurant. But it was all about the experience and we did see a few celebrities.",
      "I\u2019d heard a lot about this place so I knew I needed to check it out when I came to California. And man, the hype was real. Service was amazing from start to finish, staff were all super friendly and attentive and made great conversation with us! Food was incredible too, probably some of the best chicken parm I\u2019ve ever tried. Yes it may be a little pricey, but it\u2019s worth it to come here at least every once in a while. The ambience don\u2019t miss either!",
      "Great place. Staff is very attentive but gives you your space at the same time. I asked for suggestions, and all suggestions hit THE SPOT. I just wish the fishes came with some sort of sides. I got the bone in ribeye (medium rare, chard) it was PERFECT, but it needed a side of mash or veggies, and it didn't have that. But over all me and my fiance had a memorable time.",
      "Ohh, Craig\u2019s. My favorite restaurant and filet in all of Los Angeles. The perfect traditional steakhouse - great cuts of meat with outstanding flavor, a fantastic selection of tasty sides (creamed corn & brussel sprouts are my favorite), warm bread, delicious strong cocktails, mahogany bar & walls, and a perfect music playlist really allow for an enjoyable evening here every time. Always terrific service, friendly staff, and a really fun buzz inside. Never too loud, always just right. And you never know who could walk through that door. Craig\u2019s, thank you for a delightful dining experience every time.",
      "Lovely dining experience. Food and service were great. A good spot for locals or visitors!"

      "I go to the NY bar all the time. It's one of my favorite bars in the world and for sure I'm going to compare the two. It's very chill here, it has a different bar in the back and a stage area. The interior is very ... Los Angeles. You get the impression that perhaps this place used to be a dinner.  The drinks are just as good and they have their own unique drinks and cocktails here.  Definitely try the Magic School Bus if it's still on the menu.  A must go for anyone who frequents the NY Bar.",
      "The best and only place for delicious drinks and unique ambience. Their drink menu is out of this world. I come here often, so last time when I got bored with the menu, the bartender made his own creations by request based on my preference. Always a good crowd and a good conversation with the staff! 100% recommend it for a date night, casual night out with friends, really good food and the best drinks in this pet of town.",
      "Drinks are solid here. I came here a few times and there was always a solid crowd.\n\nSeats are not hard to find if you come late. It's a pretty pack around 11pm, but slows down a little after midnight.\n\nThere is a DJ on Fridays and some room for people to dance.",
      "Vibe vibe vibe! Drinks were delish with a unique \u201cEmployees Only\u201d logo engraved in the large ice. We enjoyed a great selection of whisky cocktails and to top it all off, chicken noodle soup for last call! Great experience and establishment!",
      "I was a vendor at this venue, so I didn't drink or eat food. The guests seemed pleased with the dronks and were sharing positive feedback about them. Staff were helpful, pleasant,  and professional, creating a comfortable,  classy atmosphere.  The club was uniquely configured and seemed to have plenty of room for a party or club gathering. I was in the back bar area with a large bar, room for dancing, tables for eating, and enough room for an ice sculpting on the bartop.  There was a photo booth area and space left for me to serve my clients with a medium length table and 2 benches.\nI took Lyft in, but there was valet parking.  Street parking was challenging and not  available. There was parking beside the building, but it looked like valet parking had control of that area.\nThe venue had a great sound system, and the DJ and a couple of Live performers were the front dance floor area. There was also a smaller bar in the front area. The music was TOO loud for my taste because customers could barely hear me. Thank goodness I had a portable amplifier. But it went out towards the end of the event, and I had to use a piece of  hard paper to create a makeshift megaphone \ud83d\udce3 .  Also, it was very dark in my corner of the back bar area but I always bring a small desk lamp \ud83d\udd26 to all my events JUST IN CASE. The rest if the back bar and front dance floor were lit for a normal bar/ party experience.  I recommend you check out if you would like to party. I was at this location for a 300-year celebration of a libations company, and their staff was having a blast."

      "Super cute spot and great vibes here! I last went a couple years ago for Happy Hour and I remember drinks were cheap and yummy plus they had a bunch of gluten free options.\n\nI went back with high expectations and the food was yummy but there were limited options for gluten allergies. I got the L.A. Smash Burger and the House Salad. The dressing on the salad was unique and delicious and the burger was good, but since I needed it to be gluten free and bun-less, I\u2019m not sure if it was worth $17!",
      "I was very impressed as I walked in past the stylish bar and we were seated inside late in the evening. It was easy to hear each other (very important to me) and the almost perfect soft lighting and decor was ambient and pleasant.\n\nAs we started reviewing the menu I was impressed to see two small rechargeable lamps on the backs of our booth so moved them to the table where all 5 of us were switching our aggressive phone lights on to try to read the small texted menus.\n\nI was flabbergasted when one of the staff removed the lights from our table pretty aggressively and told me the lights were only meant for decor. I explained we couldn't read the menus in the lighting and he simply reassured me I should use my phone and could leave if I wanted to. I requested to speak to the manager to which he explained he was the manager. I left the table to speak to him directly and respect my friends and his solution was to offer me the door again.\n\nNot sure about my friends but I found the spaghetti Arrabiata to have well cooked spaghetti, great portion size (not too big) but it didn't have much flavor except salty and spicy.\n\nOverall the prices seemed very reasonable, the wait staff attentive and I really enjoyed the experience, save the lighting saga.\n\nI looked to speak to the manager as we left to see if he had anything more to say to me, alas he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nI'd easily give this place a 4 or 5 star rating for all the other reasons but in my life I've never had an experience like this in the 30+ countries I've been to.\n\nI highly recommend a customer service course for the manager.",
      "Really fantastic environment. I wasn't sure what to think about when the menu looked so basic, but the food they made was all the pleasures of life with the right balance of flavors and exceptionally prepared. I also got a cocktail because they looked amazing in the pictures I saw online and they didn't disappoint. I got a tangy margarita. Their mains were a bit expensive so I didn't indulge in that, but pasta, pizza, and burgers were reasonably priced for a nice night out. 10/10 would come back again.",
      "A cool place for cocktails and small bites. Was surprised by the quality of my burger especially since their afternoon menu is so small. We had tomatoes and burrata as well but the portion of burrata was quite small. The cocktail I had was pretty good as well. We had to place our orders at the bar which is fine but I do prefer actually being served at my table. The atmosphere is cool and they allow dogs on their back patio. Do recommend, I'm sure I'll return as it's in my neighborhood.",
      "Really great spot for a nice and casual meal. Great drinks, I suggest the tequila tang. I've tried most of their menu at this point and while their menu does change from time to time, my current favorites are the butternut squash soup, the spicy vodka pasta, and the brussel sprouts. I've had mixed experiences with the pizza, on non-crowded nights it was great and on crowded nights we experienced slightly charred pizza and just barely cooked pizza (but we also showed up in the last 90 minutes of service and like I said, the place was packed). Smash burger is pretty solid as well. Definitely on the pricier side but very good. Staff has always been incredible. I haven't tried the wings yet so no comment there. Give it a go!"

      "We were a group of 4 girls and ordered the right amount of food! Hard to pick just one item but the highlight of the dinner was the burrata with caviar. Everything was excellent! Beautiful ambiance sitting outside.",
      "Great addition to Sunset Plaza! Food was solid. The warm lobster roll was the winner of the night. Also loved the torched salmon belly, crispy branzino, crab toast and calamari. Drinks are delicious, loved the pear cocktail and the espresso martini is perfection. The ginger bundt cake was also stellar. We also ordered the dover sole and for $80, it was disappointing. The texture was very rubbery. Our server, Rosie, was fantastic - very attentive and professional. Knocked off a star because at the end of the night, the hostess told us to leave the table for the next reservation. I totally understand that, but there\u2019s a nice, polite way to say it instead of demanding it. Definitely ended the night on a bit of a downer. I would come back, but maybe hang out at the bar with the yummy drinks and a lobster roll",
      "One of the best seafood meals I\u2019ve had and such a lovely experience! The clam chowder, scallop sashimi, mussels, the Lobster roll and amazing fish dishes were all prepared perfectly! Everything we had was delicious and the service was top notch. Great for a special dinner and I suggest the \u201cSaltie\u201d Martini, you won\u2019t be disappointed!\nInsider tip: There\u2019s free parking in the back and Brunch on the weekends!",
      "I was really excited to try this place but it was pretty over-hyped for the food quality and price (I had heard great things about the Boston location). Ordered the raw bar shrimp ($8 each and not properly cleaned), the salmon crudo, and a lobster roll which was fine. I liked the atmosphere and they had a bunch of nice non-alcoholic drinks on the menu.",
      "Believe the hype about this Boston based restaurant which made its way to the west coast.  Made reservations on Resy and that was such a good decision.   This a great restaurant to enjoy your \u201csee-food\u201d diet.   I see the food and just want to eat it.   Even before I got there there were so many items on menu that I wanted to try.     We ordered several dishes to share: the crispy blue fin tuna roll, 1/2 dozen oysters, torched salmon belly, calamari and the lobster roll.\n\nLet\u2019s get right to the point- the lobster roll melts in your mouth, it\u2019s phenomenal and after ordering just one to share this was the one regret as I wanted more and could have devoured it all by myself.  Its market price so ended up being $42.  Now it\u2019s on the pricey side but definitely worth it and was more than satisfied.  Loved the service, vibe and especially the food.\n\nWas already planning our next dinner while we were eating our dinner.  Parking was easy as they have a parking lot in the back."

      "My sister and I had a brunch celebration after my graduate school graduation ceremony. It was a five-star experience from the minute we walked in the door. What a fabulous host and fabulous bar staff. We enjoyed our cocktails, croissant French toast, goat cheese balls and other delicious treats! The atmosphere was gorgeous and laid back at the same time. We are planning another trip from Texas and definitely another visit!",
      "As a huge fan of Vanderpump rules, I had been eager to try this restaurant for years. It did not disappoint! What really impressed me was the interesting menu. I saw dishes I\u2019ve never seen before in my life. The hibiscus smoked salmon was incredible, what a unique and fun combination of flavours. Thank you for the great time!",
      "Had an awesome time at this place. A very nice meal, drinks and very attentive waiter who made sure everything was ok and dietary requirements were met without any worry. The place turns into a club disco with fab music and they had a beautiful singer there, although embarrassingly I didn't notice until she sat in front of me singing! I thought it was another great song! What a voice she had, wow! Lovely meal, lovely place, definitely recommended.",
      "I came here for a surprise birthday party and it was incredible! The staff were friendly and attentive; our server was very knowledgeable and made wonderful suggestions! The scallops that were on special were wonderful. I loved everything we had! The entire place is gorgeous too, looking forward to experiencing this again soon. Highly recommend. Be sure to make reservations",
      "Came here during happy hour -> dinner.\n\nThe staff was very accommodating when we came over without a reservation and with a fairly large party. They noticed that we just came fresh from a Graduation ceremony and promptly opened up a room for us, and allowed us to loiter in there eating small dishes until their dinner service was ready.\n\nStarting off with the happy hour food.\n1) Skip the Sliders, this was just OK, but not worth the price nor the food space\n2) Fries, these fries were fried where it still had a crunch with a fluffy inside, even after cooling down. The fries themselves were already seasoned, there was no need for any ketchup\n3) Chip and Cheese Dip, the cheese string pull was amazing and the dip itself was jam packed with flavor\n\nOnwards to the dinner portion.\n1) The Tuna Tartare was alright, wasn't particularly outstanding but overall was decent\n2) The Fish Dish, it was slightly spicy, the kind where it's there and you feel it, but it also didnt linger too long, nor did it make you scurry for the water. The fish itself was also pretty tender, it had a delightful fish flavor and it tore away fairly easily."

      "Stella is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to dine in LA. Amazing food. Excellent service. If you're into crudo, order the table-side Hamachi. It's everything! There is also a very different vibe on the first floor. It's actually a floor down from the main floor. It has an open concept kitchen and a viewing window for the fresh pasta makers of the restaurant.",
      "I had wonderful attentive service as a single diner. I sat at the bar near the kitchen as a walk in.  It was fun to watch everything. My only caveats is that since they are running open flame they blast the AC which I appreciated but I sometimes felt like I was sitting in a wind tunnel.  Not their fault, I could've chosen to sit elsewhere. My only note for seating to the restaurant is they need to add grips to the bottom of the chairs. If I turned a bit in my chair, the chair would slide. And the chair is not that comfortable. It felt low for a counter stool and the seat narrows so I was often shifting in my seat and then I would get further and further away from the table and had to awkwardly scoot up. And I think the people sitting a few seats down had the same issue.  They had to extend their legs awkwardly out to create tension for sitting.\n\nThe pasta is fantastic! I had the octopus pasta and it was cooked well and was delicious.  It's a little bit spicy and the pasta was a unique shape. I had the king fish crudo which was lovely, and a seasonal melon salad that had fresh melon and pickled melon which I found interesting but would probably never order again.  I liked the eggplant side but the pasta! I did really love the pasta.\n\nThe ambience and style is gorgeous.\n\nOne last thought - - better towels for the bathroom.\n\nBut would definitely come again.\n\nThere's valet but I found street parking on a side street and there's two hour metered parking on the same street.",
      "Had an amazing dinner at Stella\u2019s! Every dish from the appetizers to the desserts was perfection. The pasta tasted like it was made fresh in-house, and the flavors were just incredible. The staff made us feel so welcome, adding to the whole experience. It\u2019s clear they put a lot of love into their food and service. Can\u2019t wait to go back!",
      "I had the pleasure of dining at Stella on their first night of service and I have to say I was blown away. The design by prominent restaurant designer Wendy Hayworth is stunning with attention to detail to inspire. You feel transported to another place and time with luxury and artistry at every turn from the lighting to the vintage glasses and elegant plateware. The music really made the vibe something special including some of my unexpected and favorite early 2000s r&b jams. The right music can take the vibe to a 10- and this was it for us!\n\nNow on to the food and drinks, every dish impressed us with it's fresh high quality ingredients, beautiful and creative presentation and  plating , and delicious robust flavors. Chef Rob Gentile is indeed a star with incredible attention to detail in all of this dishes. My favorite in experiential presentation and taste was the tableside carved branzino carpaccio. The Salmon was a close second. As simple as it was the citrus salad was divine too! To top it off, as a very Italian restaurant you never know, but they happily accommodated my gluten free and dairy free dietary restrictions :) Their cocktails were beautiful and well balanced.\n\nThis would be a spectacular place for a private event or private dining from the patio to the two private dining rooms and giant bars and captivating spaces on two levels- I can't wait to bring back friends and clients and entertain here.\n\nThe service was exceptional. It was not pretentious, very warm welcoming and fun with the utmost VIP hospitality. Stella was exceptional and the experience was worth the price- you must celebrate here!!",
      "Tired of the same scene-to-be-seen high end Italian place? Want to experience some of the best and truly delicious Italian food in Los Angeles? Try Stella. Gorgeous interiors, attentive without being intrusive service, and some standout food (and wide ranging menu) in a part of LA where you\u2019d normally see women pick at their food. They\u2019re eating here and smiling. Standout dishes: eggplant parmigiana side dish, mortadella & pistachio pizza, and any dessert. Well worth the price tag and a great date spot\u2026or just a place to feel yourself and eat wonderful food."

      "Tail o' the Pup is a classic hot dog stand that has been around the Los Angeles scene since 1946. As well as with Pinks, it is one of the longest lived hot dog stands in this neck of the woods.\nThe original stand survives to this day and was in the Beverly center before moving it to WeHo on Santa Monica Blvd.\nThey offer a variety of food, which is normal fare for the Hot dig stand variety. Burgers, French fries, milkshakes, and the like.  Obviously, their specialty are the dogs in which the name of the establishment proudly has in its moniker.\nThe dogs have a nice snap to them, and are cooked well throughout. You have a variety of different versions available to you such as Chicago, chili, ballpark, dogs famous through their respective years.\nThe choices are endless.\nIt's historical. It's a nice nook to escape from the Los Angeles insanity. It's a time capsule of delicious proportions. Come on down and let the Dogs convince you on their own.",
      "We\u2019ve been wanting to go here ever since it re-opened and it didn't disappoint. We are not a huge fan of hot dogs in general, but if we were to go out for a dog, this place is near the top of the list. The dogs had a good snap to them and tasted delish. The chili was peppery with a slight kick; perfect for a topping on the dog or fries. Plenty of seating indoors or outside. They even have the coca-cola mix machines so you can create any flavor combo you like. Our only gripe was that it is fairly expensive for the portion size. I expected more fries and a larger dog for the prices they charge. Bathroom was clean. Depending on time of day, parking could be tough.",
      "Such a great place with so much history!  Hands down the best hot dogs we have ever had!  Loved the adorable puppy hot dog trays.  Service was good.  Everyone was very nice.  A bit pricey for hot dogs and fries, but happy to pay it for a small, historic, business.",
      "Horrible experience in restaurant. Food was gross, the corn dog looked like it was petrified from hell. The regular hotdogs were sloppily dressed and tasted staler than a 7-11 dog. It was comical to watch a bureaucratic process from line level to manager to figure out to change out a soap dispenser in the bathroom. I\u2019m not going waste my waste my time detailing further but the soap dilemma seemed like something out of an SNL skit given the level of disfunction between the staff. Never will go again.",
      "Food was really good. Vegan options. A lot of mentally ill unhoused people around who kept getting really close to me. So that made me feel unsafe."

      "The food here is decent, but pricey (though many restaurants in West Hollywood are expensive). I got a special panzanella salad starter that was good, though pretty small for $16. Lasagna was good, and I liked the house made cheese in it a lot, though I thought the tomato sauce tasted a bit sweet for my tastes. Pizza was a bit greasier than what I prefer for Neapolitan style. I really love and appreciate that there is such a special vegan Italian restaurant in LA, though I do wish the food was a bit less expensive. The staff was wonderful! Very friendly and attentive.",
      "Wow! This place is awesome! They certainly captivated the tight spaced dining experience just like it is in italy, (not sure if that was on purpose or coincidence) but it was spot on! When we first walked in, we were hesitant because it just looked like a bar because the entrance was just the bar area, but when we went inside we were meeted with a kind waiter who lead us to the dining area and got us started. The food is spectacular, and you couldn\u2019t even tell it is a vegan restaurant! We got the grilled citrus herb tofu and that was so delicious and the sauce was so light and creamy. Love the addition of pesto as well. We also got the Polpettine appetizer which are basically just vegan meatballs and my god they were so good. Then our mains came out and I got the seasonal pasta menu item which was a pea and lemon herb creamy sauce pasta which was so flavorful and light and just perfect for the spring time. My mother got the eggplant parmigiana and she told me it was indeed delicious. This was the best restaurant i\u2019ve been to in the area so far! But the bill certainly did hurt the bank, but the company and food was worth it.",
      "I love this place!!!!! One of my favorite vegan restaurants around and who does not love pizza and pasta!?!!  A true Italian gem and you don't even need to be vegan to enjoy this place. ANYTHING you order... Let me repeat.... ANYTHING you order will not disappoint. Baked ricotta, mozzarella sticks, pizza, Caesar salad, pasta... It is all excellent! The wine selection is incredible as well. I love the romantic atmosphere but would recommend playing Italian music to match the concept of the restaurant. It's usually rockabilly or blues/rock which is great for the pizzeria and I love that music, but I would rather hear Dean Martin or Sinatra. The servers are super friendly but at times, they zoom past your table and you have to flag them down. I look forward to dining here for brunch as it looks AMAZING! AND the cannoli's should be a permanent dessert on the menu. Expect to drop a pretty penny for the experience.",
      "Literally the best vegan food in Los Angeles, Italian or otherwise. I was almost raised on authentic Italian cuisine, nearly every weekend in Little Italy in NYC and this also tops anything else I've had vegan or otherwise. We\u2019ll be back so much it'll be ridiculous. Thank you to the impeccable staff, our sever was above and beyond \u2014truly everyone and everything was.",
      "Load up the carbs!!! This place is fabulous, honestly if you\u2019re looking for vegan Italian this would be my choice 10/10. I haven\u2019t had carbonara since becoming vegan and the vegan carbonara \ud83c\udf5d is so good!!! Ask for the chili oil and flakes to give it a little spice"

      "If you're in LA and looking for the best breakfast you can imagine, head to The Butcher, The Baker, The Cappuccino Maker. I tried their Bananas Foster French Toast, and it was absolutely criminal how delicious it was! This isn't just French toast; it's the ultimate version, setting a new standard for breakfast indulgence. The toast was perfectly crispy on the outside, soft inside, with a rich, caramelized banana topping that made every bite heavenly. Honestly, it\u2019s the best French toast I\u2019ve ever had. The cozy ambiance and friendly staff just added to the fantastic experience. Don't miss out on this gem!",
      "It\u2019s definitely crowded, but the location and the ambience are still impeccable. We also didn\u2019t wait too long, so that\u2019s a big plus.\n\nThe service is very good, and our host was able to get us a table in a very short amount of time. He was also incredibly nice and went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect.\n\nThe food is unforgettable. We also got the color splash latte (I don\u2019t recall if that\u2019s the exact name), and it was beautifully made. The french toast and Eggs Benedict were also heavenly.",
      "This is a cute brunch place. The service and atmosphere are amazing. We ordered homemade cornbread, the butcher Benedict, banana foster French toast and unsweetened matcha latte. The cornbread was amazing, it is a must try. The Benedict was missing some flavor. The potatoes came with the Benedict had too much dill on it. The French toast was okay. I like the unsweetened matcha. Overall, if you are around the area, you can try it.",
      "First time coming. Thankful we had reservations for brunch. We got our table right away. Note- they won\u2019t seat you until your full party arrives. 90 minute table limit.\n\nThe service was great all around. We felt so welcomed by the front of house staff that seated us. Once at our table our server was fantastic. Checked on us consistently and was overall quite pleasant.\n\nThe burger was great. The potato bites are insanely delicious. They don\u2019t serve fries- but I wasn\u2019t let down at all. The fried chicken wrap was also really good. Glad we got a few entrees to share.\n\nI did the Bloody Mary. Loved it. We also did the mimosas flight. Super fun and good. We did order an extra bottle of the Prosecco to top us off. The latte was as cute as it was enjoyable.\n\nWould absolutely recommend coming here. Such a delight of a spot. Food and service both really great. Location couldn\u2019t be better. Thanks for such a great Easter Brunch!",
      "I came for the painted latte which was really neat and delicious! I would recommend it for the fun of the experience. Food and atmosphere I would give 4 stars.  It is nice to sit outside, but it  is close to the road and other tables. I ordered eggs Benedict with breakfast potatoes. I would try something else next time as I did not care for the biscuits ( too dry) and my food was not very hot. Not a bad experience and would suggest giving them a go!"

One of them helped me recreate a new drink to better align with the flavors I like.\n\nThe food was also yummy and come out quickly. I will absolutely come back here.",
      "Truly a great experience! Everyone was so attentive and respectful. The music made me feel like I was in a safe space. It was my first time here, and most certainly won\u2019t be my last!The drinks were delicious. I was able to get the Guava Island and had that all night. Truffle fries were a fancier version of animal style fries. DELICIOUS. #denonsunset #buzzybooth",

      "The way I used to love this place and its food, I\u2019ve been coming here for the last year, but since February the quality has completely gone down.  We ordered 2 burgers to go and paid 60 dollars for it to completely destroy both of our stomachs. We had to cancel our plans because we were feeling sick. Seriously still upset and you should do better because customers who used to come in twice a week probably never going to come in again after this.",

      "This place was recommended by my brother in law. We went not knowing what to expect. I have only one word to say about this place- WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nChef Sam was spectacular! Thank you to Chef Michael for making our visit truly special. Thank you to our server Romeo for taking extra care of us. Thank you to Mr Bill and his special Magma Hot Pepper that was on our table all the way from NJ!\n\nThe pictures cannot share the immense joy we had tasting each and every single dish we tried.\n\nConnie and Ted\u2019s is a true gem! If I could just live there and be fed everyday I totally would!",
      "Fantastic place for seafood. I\u2019d love to come back. We had the chowder sampler (the traditional one was best), oysters, lobster roll and the Sunday\u2019s special fried chicken. I recommend the lobster roll (hot) and the oysters for sure. The chicken was somewhat subpar. It\u2019s probably best to get seafood at a seafood restaurant, not chicken.",
      "Went on the  weekend (Saturday) for lunch/ brunch. The chowder's were very satisfying as a starter. Crab cake, salad, and butternut squash were delicious. Our main entrees were Black Cod and Black Sea Bass, which were delicately prepared and melted in our mouths.",
      "I loved my experience!!\n\nI am a bonafide New Englander and when I heard that there was a seafood restaurant in West Hollywood owned by other new Englanders I knew I had to try it out!\n\nEverything was delicious and our server was on point!",
      "I\u2019ve done lunch and dinner here several times, and my rating tends to vary between three and four stars from meal to meal, but mostly three stars.\nThe atmosphere is nice for a fish restaurant but nothing exceptional.\nGrilled calamari is tasty, but small and seems to be breaded.\nFried calamari is good but not very meaty.\nCrab cake is so buttery you don\u2019t taste the crab.\nButternut squash side dish is very very sweet.\nOcean trout was over cooked but otherwise okay.\nFriends I was with didn\u2019t like the fried fish nor the fried calamari."

      "One of the best and unique Chinese noodle restaurant in West Hollywood.\nFirst time here and I tell you I am impressed and on awe!\nEvery dish that we ordered was unique in its own flavor, and freshness from the dumplings, mapo tofu, to the simplest smashed cucumber salad.\nMy favorite was five spice beef, and the pork dumplings.\nAll the noodles are made fresh by the special chef and they come in 8 different shape and are made to order.\nI will definitely be back to try other dishes.",
      "Amazing Chinese food with a unique flavor profile. I can honestly say I\u2019ve never tasted anything like it. It is anything but run of the mill. I tried their chow mein and it was amazing. The Dan Dan noodles are great too but spicy. They have several different noodle shapes to choose from. One is triangular! Wow! They make the noodles in house and you can even watch them do this! Service is really great. They voided my Dan Dan dish because it was too hot for me and I didn\u2019t even have to ask for that. The cashier suggested it. There\u2019s parking in a structure beneath the mall this restaurant is located in.",
      "Finally an authentic Lanzhou noodle around WeHo.\nI had the Lan noodle, thick flat noodle soup topped with slices of beef.\nI also had the cold chicken dish - scallion chicken.\nBoth dishes tasted authentic.\n\nI was told the braised feed is the most popular item. I\u2019ll try that next time!\n\nThe service was very quick. My noodles came out in just few minutes of wait.\n\nThere is also free parking for 1 hour at the basement.",
      "Incredible food, fair prices, and great service. Some of most authentic and fresh Szechuan you\u2019ll get in the US.\n\nThe food came out in almost 5 minutes and the waitress was very helpful throughout the meal. She even let us try a cup of a sour plum drink before we bought it just to make sure we\u2019d like it.\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong here but I\u2019d recommend the Dan Dan Noodle, Mapo tofu, chili oil splash noodle, cucumber, and pan fried chicken potstickers.",
      "Good food. Had the veggie flat wide dry noodles with mango smoothie. So much flavor. Noodle made to order and cooked to perfection. Mago smoothie was  delicious  not too watery not too thick perfectly blended. Atmosphere was nice not too crowded, clean. Service was fast . All the workers were so nice and kind and definitely work as a team to take care of guests definitely will be back and can't wait."

I would've tried the food if anyone would have offered to ask for my order. The menu did look appealing, though. Maybe I'll have a better experience next visit.",
      "Great cocktails. They have mixology classes which I think could be very interesting.\n\nThe place gets busy around 6pm, right after happy hours end. Although a bartender may forget to charge HH rate, this happened to me.",
      "Mid. The cocktails are aesthetic and tasty, if you can actually get someone to take an order and get them to you. All the waiters were congregated in the corner chatting with one another while drinks sat empty for 20+ minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool place to go, just lower your expectations and you\u2019ll be fine",
      "Visited this rooftop with standard LA decor and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly server who swiftly resolved a minor order mistake. Although the Saturday afternoon brunch menu was on the smaller side, everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed their meals. We ordered the breakfast hash, burger and avocado toast - all good but nothing to rave about.",
      "Nice rooftop bar with an awesome atmosphere. Music is great and the drinks (we got) were delicious! 2 bars upstairs so there\u2019s no major wait.\nStaff here super friendly and accommodating, security let us in but informed us next time dress code applies no shorts after 9pm.\nAs It Was, Mr Roboto, Blinding Lights were our favorite drinks of the night!"

      "Overall we really enjoyed our dinner. I had the veal parmigiana which was good. The atmosphere was great and our server was great and such a character! He made our dinner fun.  It\u2019s a spot worth exploring as it\u2019s an iconic place.",
      "The atmosphere here!!! The food was excellent! I had the scallops with linguine! Yum!! Everybody in the entire place sang Happy Birthday to two different people as the wait staff served them cake. I think it's some sort of tradition, because everybody in the whole place joined in! And somebody yelled a couple times , \"Dan Tana's on a Sunday night!\" You definitely got the feeling that there were actors, writers, and producers here that were just hanging out at \"the corner bar\"\n. They have plaques on the wall from the city of Los Angeles celebrating their 50th anniversary from 10 years ago. So they have been there at that location for 60 years now! You could tell that most of the people knew each other and were regulars. It is steps away from the Beverly Hills sign. It is very small and intimate. It was solidly expensive! And it was worth every penny! The food was superb! And more than one person (discreetly) came by my table to make sure everything was up to par!\n(I went to see singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan after dinner just a few steps away at that famous old club called the Troubadour.) Did I mention the atmosphere and crusty bread??!!\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\nOh, and the waiter! He was so cool! He introduced me to a couple of other guys who were going to see the show next door at the Troubadour. I think one of them was Engelbert Humperdinck.(Wow!) It was very nice of the waiter to make the introduction. Did I mention that I had a wonderful time, and that the food was excellent!? Again, Wow!",
      "This one is a bummer.  Sure, the place has an iconic LA history, but is it worth it?  For our party of 3, last Tuesday night, it sure wasn't.   We arrived at 7:25 for a 7:30 reservation.  Our entire party was there.  Checked in with the hostess... and waited..  and waited....and waited.  The hostess kept smiling and working the room.  Fifteen minutes go by, then 30... we check in about our table...\"Almost!\"  ...\"soon!\".....45 min...we then realize that anyone who they know is seated immediately....but newcomers get to wait.  What good is a reservation?  It ain't worth nothing here.  The hostess starts pouring on the compliments, \"Oh, I love your shoes, oh here's some matches, oh!  You guys win the prize for waiting the longest for your table!\"   I don't want that prize, I want a table and a nice dinner!   Then at about an hour and 10 minutes, only after staring the hostess down as she's about to seat another 3 top of \"regulars\" do we get our table, and then we get seated at a truly horrible table outside with zero ambiance.  The gregarious waiter greets us, and I ask if it's normal to wait an hour for a table?  And almost as if rehearsed, cuz we know he's heard this before, he almost yells, \"YES!  IT IS!\"  We were all pretty agitated and irritated at this point, so it affected the meal... which was lackluster at best.    Overcooked rubbery fried calamari, underseasoned caesar...I will say the chicken parm was good.  They did end up comping our drinks, but  the entire evening was off because of their poorly run system of seating people.  This was confirmed by the hostess when we encountered her again when we were leaving, she actually referred to it as a living museum, not sure if she meant the restaurant itself or the regulars, but thats what she said......Sorry guys, this is a Los Angeles love affair that I'm happy to break up with.",
      "We tried this place after reading about it plus our enjoyment of Italian food and Old Hollywood. Everything was wonderful.\n\nWe did see James Woods dining as well, as this place is famous for being a spot for celebrities.",
      "What a truly special place! To start, the service was amazing!!! Not only efficient teamwork but they all had a great sense of humor! We started with what the waiter claimed was the best Caesar salad in LA. He wasn\u2019t lying. At the end of our entrees, there wasn\u2019t a morsel of food on a single plate (party of 13). Not because the portions were small (they are huge), but because the food was so good. We tried a few different desserts and all were amazing! Thanks Dan Tana\u2019s for a special night that exceeded our lofty expectations!"

      "We had a large party tonight for a celebration. Thankfully they brought out 3 servings of chips with guac/salsa because we waited at least 10 minutes before a waiter came to take drink orders. Had to flag someone down AGAIN to place food orders. Our two vegan/vegetarians received MEAT in their dishes and then waited at least 10 minutes to receive the correct dish. It wasn't that crowded but clearly they needed a server that can handle a large party. Food was just ok which was disappointing having spent time in Oaxaca. I'm only giving 3 stars for food because pricing was reasonable based on size of dishes. Wouldn't recommend, wouldn't come back. Skip it.",
      "Superb food, if you come early you get great service, they\u2019re a bit short handed so come early. The service was amazing, everyone is so nice. We enjoy the food so much. The food is oaxcan from the state of Oaxaca in Mexico so it\u2019s very different, their Mole sauce is divine. The churro with Mole sauce was divine. Don\u2019t leave without ordering Churros, it\u2019s an experience. Highly recommend this place.",
      "It\u2019s a very good restaurant in this neighbourhood. They have many outdoor tables if you prefer outdoor seating. The service is awesome. Every single one takes care of you very nice and sincerely. The food was brilliant. Sooooo delicious! You wouldn\u2019t stop eating! And the cocktails are wonderful too! FYI, don\u2019t order extra tortillas, you may literally have some tortillas with every single dish. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c"

The prices are higher but pretty comparable to other hotels. I got a vegetarian breakfast burrito and honestly it was a good burrito but I feel like $20 for just the burrito but no sides is a bit much for me. But that's just me. In reality it's a pretty average price. Anyways food was good, service was great, atmosphere is nice but overall nothing to write home about.",
      "The food is appetizing and tasty though nothing about the offerings are particularly outstanding in terms of flavor and presentation compared to other offerings in area.\n\nConvenient for a quick bite if you are staying at the Andaz though I would venture to other restaurants if you are just passing through or visiting the area.\n\nOverall, I was whelmed with my experience here and would visit again only if I were, again, a guest at the Andaz to take advantage of room charging for points bonuses.\n\nEdit: Breakfast is really tasty! Definitely enjoyed their breakfast offerings moreso than the lunch/dinner menu!",
      "It\u2019s my first full day in LA. I thought it was a lame move to eat at the hotel instead of going out but I took the lazy road!\n\nHonestly, I had a great experience. Definitely stop in for coffee + breakfast if you are staying at the Andaz. We shared the corned beef benny and an almond croissant. Check the pics - it was the biggest croissant I\u2019ve ever seen!!! \ud83e\udd50\ud83e\udd50\ud83e\udd50\n\nThe service was a home run \ud83e\ude90Andrew was our waiter and he was so friendly and attentive. Little things make a big difference for me\u2026 He split the benny into two dishes because we mentioned that we were sharing. He asked if I wanted ketchup or hot sauce (always a yes from me \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd75) before the food came out. And he put in this care while the place was pretty full! I also saw the manager/host going around to tables and checking in with guests. Great staff all around.",
      "In my view this is primarily a restaurant attached to the Andaz hotel.  Translation:  very expensive for casual dining.  That said, the breakfast was quite extensive with everything from fruit to meats and omelets to order.  It is a nice space and the coffee was decent.  Would I visit the space if I was not traveling - probably not.",

The food was amazing, the staff was kind and helpful. I would really like to mention our server, Zarah who made the whole experience. She was willing to take photos of my girlfriend and me and also she recommended some amazing drinks. We are really excited to come back here. I appreciate everyone who helped give my girlfriend the best birthday experience .",
      "Beautiful space and ambiance coupled with the most attentive service I\u2019ve ever experienced at a restaurant. Our server Johnny was top notch\u2014incredibly personable and paid so much attention to every little detail, even noticing when we had dropped a napkin and bringing newly folded ones over. Also loved that they offered vegan options for the burger (delicious!) and risotto (not the best I\u2019ve ever had but still good). Their guacamole with plantain chips was so yummy. There was also an incredibly talented musician moving through the packed restaurant playing exotic string instruments along with the DJ\u2014on a Monday night! Perfect night out in Hollywood",
      "I am uploading pictures of the items that are worth buying. I do not understand why this place has only 3.9 stars. I believe this experience was 5 out of 5 stars. I have been in a lot of good restaurants in L.A. but this one by far surpassed my expectations due to the good vibes and the way the staff made me feel. Ally was the person who provided the service of hosting us and she was absolutely GREAT. I enjoyed having a GENUINE (not fake) professional who can make me feel welcome and happy. I was celebrating a special occasion and she made sure to be funny but at the same time not pushy and polite. The staff at front, I do not have her name but she was amazing and complimented my whole outfit. I ONLY take the time to give REAL reviews about people that make me feel good. There was a woman playing live violin and I think it added to the whole vibe. I recommend this place because of MY experience. I am glad I did not let myself be influenced by negative comments because I would have skip a night to remember. I WILL BE BACK! You have to know that parking is an issue but if you do Valet Parking, they are super nice and accept card and it is 25. You still need a stamp from the front desk. YOU ARE WELCOME ;)",
      "Such a cute restaurant. Food was amazing and our server John was great! He gave us the best advice on what to order and everything was delish. My husband is lactose intolerant so he was able to point him to dishes that could accommodate that.",
      "One of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles! The service is always outstanding, and the food is delicious. The lounge music with live DJ sets creates a perfect atmosphere, in harmony with the interior design of the place. Additionally, the view of the city from above is truly spectacular recommend to anyone looking to enjoy a special evening!\""

      "Truly a faultless experience! The atmosphere is very upscale, yet comfortable. The food was exceptional. Every dish we ordered felt elevated and was delicious - shout out to the Lions Mane cakes, fries, ravioli and brownie.\n\nAnd to top it all off, you can smoke weed right at the table! We had so much fun and I can\u2019t wait to go back!",
      "Amazing new place with that allows you to smoke at the table. They start you off with a smoke menu and you can rent a bong for $25, you close out and pay for any of that before you order food. You can't order alchohol at the table they have a seperate bar for that, but all the food is sharable portions and you can just keep getting 1 or 2 at a time. Food was great and we didnt feel rushed or anything, super comfortable and unique.",
      "You must experience, if you are a gardener and a foodie! The vibe, service and portions were great. When ordering, we put everything in at once and I would recommend sending 1-2 things in at a time. The food did arrive luke warm and quickly turned cold due to how cold they have to keep the restaurant. You don\u2019t need cash for the gardening part, they take card but charge $3. I\u2019d recommend bringing a jacket as the restaurant is pretty cold due."

      "Yo mama don't cook like this.\n\nTu Madre is a cute little taqueria just off of Santa Monica, with absolutely amazing food. We ordered an array of tacos, all of which impressed:\n\nFried Chicken: 9/10\nSweet N Sour Chicken: 8/10\nCrispy potato: 10/10\nCrispy fish: 9/10\nKBBQ street taco: 10/10\nCarne Asada: 8/10\nBrisket: 8/10\n\nI've previously ordered food from Tu Madre via a delivery app and the food is equally as good. The one warning I'll give for the tacos is that they aren't the biggest portions, and they're served on individual plates. If you have a small table, you may run out of space if you order enough tacos to be satisfied.\n\nIn addition to the large selection of tacos, they have an equally diverse drink menu. They offer margaritas by the pitcher, flight, and glass. If you order the flights, they come with a sparkler (as I said, the place is cute) for your social media memories. If you're not in a margarita mood, they also offer other cocktails and a sad selection of beer. I got a Madre Passion, which was spectacular, and my partner ordered a Deeply Rooted Issues, which was very citrusy.\n\nTu Madre would be well on its way to five stars if it weren't for one thing. Service can be slow, which is the reason for dropping a star on the overall rating. I noticed the speed of service depended on where you sat. Unfortunately for us, we weren't at an advantageous table. I think we talked to our real server once. He didn't take our order, bring the food, or help us with the check. He checked in once or twice, but that was it. Thankfully, we were heading someplace else after dinner and didn't want a second drink. Otherwise, we might still be sitting there.\n\nOverall, go to Tu Madre for the food. Or, if you live close enough, order via a delivery app and enjoy the food without the annoyance of being ignored.",
      "Food was pretty tasty. The drinks on point and the vibe was pretty chill. Good indoor and outdoor seating and decor. That said\u2026wasn\u2019t particularly taken by the service. Food is brought out in batches and on the same plate regardless of who on your table placed the order.\nParty of 4 : We all placed our order at the same time (2-3 tacos each) - I got my 1st taco out, but had to wait while the rest of my table got their order. Meanwhile one of my friends only got his 1st taco around the time the rest of us were on our 3rd order which was kinda awkward\u2026.Idk\u2026the service style seems to make it more complicated than what it has to be.",
      "I was a bit disappointed. I ordered 2 tacos KBBQ and the Fried Fish. Received what I thought was street tacos, but no their regular tacos are street sized. The KBBQ was marinated for something like 24 hours, I found it a bit chewy, not tender. The fried fish taco wasn't crispy but soggy. Our waiter was non-existent after serving. Our table of 5 quickly emptied our single water pitcher. I don't like leaving this type of review but management needs to know. Hope your experience is better than mine.",
      "Loved the fried avocado vegan bowl. Everything in was very tasty. I usually don't like rice but even the rice is flavourful. Loved it.",
      "Y\u2019all! I love this place and have frequented several times but this past Monday was my favorite. Mariah (sorry if it\u2019s spelled incorrectly) was the sweetest while taking our order and serving us. Not sure if she was on her lunch or left for the day but we didn\u2019t get to say bye.\n\nFood and drinks are sooooo delicious. Please go for the happy hour. Everything is always so colorful and vibrant. The decor makes you feel as if you\u2019re visiting another city. Service was amazing. All our food arrived fairly promptly and it never felt like we were left alone by staff for too long. Had some food leftover and yummm, it was delish!!!"

      "The two us were having an amazing dinner. We ordered drinks, appetizers, a pasta and main dish and dessert. The service was well attentive. But after we had finished dessert the hostess came up and asked us to leave because she had another reservation coming. We had been there for 1.5 hours. We were on time to our reservation. We felt it to be very rude as we were enjoying our date, the food and service. At no point was there mention of some kind of time limit. Definitely killed the vibe.",
      "Visiting from San Francisco, I could not have found a more vibey spot to enjoy a delicious dinner and vibrant social scene after our music festival.  They served us some of the best spaghetti and meatballs I\u2019ve ever had. I am trying to figure out their secret.",
      "Awesome food beautiful people and a nice host! Almost perfect the only crazy thing was the long time on the waiting list to get a table but it was rush hour so I partially understand that! I will dine in again for sure",
      "Things we loved-- great vibe. 1970s swanky. Excellent service. Good cocktails. The ravioli was our favorite dish.\n\nNot as successful -- spaghetti and meatballs, pizza, cezar salad. These were ok, but could be improved.",
      "Visited for my first time on a double date. Great dark cool atmosphere with old Hollywood vibes and a bar in the middle. I would just say get ready to be nice and cozy as the booths for 4 are very tight. This is not the place for you if you don\u2019t like a louder quite dark environment with only one little light above us illuminating our table. The food and drinks are reasonably priced. We got two pasta dishes which were both delicious. I would recommend a visit to the restroom too where you\u2019ll see thousands of photos stuck on the walls. In terms of parking, it can be quite difficult getting street parking but there is the target parking lot across the road where you\u2019ll only spend a couple of dollars for 2 hours so definitely worth it. If you\u2019re still feeling like a drink afterwards I\u2019d recommend hoping over the street to the Formosa Cafe for a night cap!"

      "I recently visited Delilah and was incredibly disappointed with the experience. We had to wait over 30 minutes past our reservation time without any communication or updates. It felt like our time was being wasted, and the staff couldn\u2019t be upfront about the delay.\n\nAdditionally, the doorman was completely disrespectful, adding to an already frustrating situation. This experience was far below the standard I expected and has left a sour taste regarding this establishment.",

At a place / high end restaurant such as Delilah I believe and stand on the service, kitchen abilities, and reputation of an establishment.\n\nHowever, again very unfortunately I took one bite into my dinner meal ($40) and chewed on paper until I finally spit it out and saw what it was!!! It turned me off from the entire meal.\n\nI DID NOT ORDER ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT, watched as my guests and company ate their dinner. Sipped my Champagne Papi, and sadly didn\u2019t get to enjoy dinner here.\n\nWouldn\u2019t come back due to the way the GM (general manager) Michelle treated the situation."

      "Had a lovely time at brunch. The food was delicious and the ambiance was mystical. Come here on the right day with the right crowd when the vibe is good and you won\u2019t even feel like you\u2019re in LA. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re on an island with some very pretty people, eating a satisfying meal soaking up the good energy. I only came here for brunch \u2026 can\u2019t comment on the rest of the menu .",
      "Last night was my birthday and i made a reservation to the Toca madera\nLet\u2019s start with that i specifically asked to have a table next to the bar and they completely ignored that.\nAfter that one of the servers brought us some shut that have fire in them and he drop them on me !!!he ruined my expensive dress that i bought especially for my birthday, he left a stain on my Chanel bag and the worst part he burn my hair \ud83d\ude22\nI completely understand that this is human mistake but I expected at least that one of the managers to come to me and apologize and offer some compensation . But no one is was care that my birthday completely destroyed because of that.\nI really don\u2019t recommend about this restaurant",
      "Absolutely loved this place. Food was great, service was amazing.\nHad so much fun celebrating birthday at the small area behind the dj booth. Not loud, warm.\nShort fire show approximately every hour.",
      "My sister and I had a great experience! Service and food were fantastic and very cool West Hollywood vibes with moody lighting and sultry design.\nThe food is fantastic, the street corn and ceviche blanco were so good as was the salsa and tacos. Every dish was sensational. The cocktails were delish, strong with great flavours. Friendly staff, attentive and great with recommendations. Follow up by management to check in on dining experience is a nice touch. Great night out \ud83c\udf78",
      "I came here with a friend on a Friday night and we weren\u2019t expecting much to be honest. We\u2019d been joking about how it was probably going to be a let down because we had no trouble booking a table the night before and assumed that it would be average because of that - thankfully we were wrong about that!\n\nFrom the service to the atmosphere to the food to the drinks, everything was perfection. I had the hamachi which was incredible and so full of flavor, as well as the crispy calamari which was delicious and not too deep fried like some tend to be. For my main I had the salmon which was beautiful. It feels like there\u2019s so much thought put into the flavor combinations. We shared the mousse for dessert which was amazing and not too sweet, it was just right. The waitress (I think her name was Madeline/Madison or something?) was so lovely and had great recommendations, she really knew the menu.\n\nIt was a Friday night so it was buzzing and very loud, so be prepared for that. There was a fire dancer that came out and danced on the bar which was really cool. Honestly everything was amazing. My friend kindly paid so I\u2019m not sure how much we spent but I assume it was a lot, but this was a case of you get what you pay for. It was the perfect middle ground between high end fine dancing and a fun L.A. party vibe. Would absolutely come back and have already recommended it to friends and family."

      "Lovely Mexican in West Hollywood. Really nice ambience/vibe. Bit more upmarket than some other Mexicans we visited in the area. We had burritos - beef birria and carnitas. Very delicious but could\u2019ve done with some guacamole inside or a dip of sour cream would\u2019ve been a nice touch! But was probably the only normal size portion we had whilst visiting america (from UK) so at least we felt alright after the meal and not stuffed! The churros were delicious too (a dipping chocolate sauce would\u2019ve been good tho!). Lovely service our waiter described all the different burrito fillings for us \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc happy hour ended at 6:30pm which was sad as it used to be 7pm",

The bowls are also a pretty decent size for a portion and they tasted really good! Highly recommend for a quick and relatively cheap dinner (compared to other mexican places).",
      "Good Mexican restaurant - I really liked the way to build your burrito, as it had multiple base options and all extras that you can add to it. Banana chips were also great, especially with guacamole. The sauce added to burrito was also good, you could feel that it\u2019s fresh.

      "One of the best breakfasts that we have had in Los Angeles this year. They specialize in dishes with caviar and although expensive it is definitely the sort of place that is worth the visit. Service was polite and prompt, and parking was extremely easy. They don\u2019t have a parking lot however, we are able to find metered street parking directly across the street. We had reservations at 11 when it opened and spent pretty much our entire meal alone in the dining area which was great. They have a lot of great options on the menu, so it was hard to choose what to order because there were so many that we wanted to get. It\u2019s really bright and open on the inside. The tables are not too close together, they have fresh flowers all around the dining area and overall it looks very elegant. They also have a large area where you can buy different jams, caviar, smoked salmon, other things.\n\nWe started off with a couple of lattes and some orange juice, which was a great and sweet start to the meal. For our dishes, we chose the Eggs Benedict and the Caviar Frites. Both had a lot of caviar on them and had delicious flavors. The eggs on the Benedict were cooked perfectly and the sauce was really well-made. The fries were good alone themselves but with the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and trout roe it really made them special.\n\nOverall a delicious brunch option in West Hollywood. I would definitely recommend to anyone and look forward to coming back in the near future.",
      "Exceptional experience at Petrossian Caviar! Chris provided an incredibly attentive caviar tasting, offering personalized recommendations and pairing suggestions with champagne that will elevate our New Year's celebration. His expertise and care made the experience unforgettable. Moreover, the meticulous packing of the caviar in ice ensured its freshness, arriving perfectly for our celebration. Thank you, Petrossian, for the exquisite service and quality products - highly recommended for anyone seeking a top-tier caviar experience!",
      "I ordered the smoked salmon flatbread and bibb salad and wish I had more room in my belly for more!\n\nThe smoked salmon flatbread was too perfect. From the perfectly baked flatbread to the sprinkles of red onion and Capers on top. I really couldn't fault it at all.\n\nThe salad was also such a great balance between the creaminess of the burrata, the crunch of the beans and radishes and the right amount of dressing. It's too bad I couldn't finish it because I was too full from taking on the flatbread solo!\n\nOverall I had a really delicious brunch, served by really friendly staff and it made for a memorable first meal in LA.\n\nIt's quite pricey but honestly worth ever penny!",
      "Best place for caviar, or a romantic French dinner date, old Hollywood style place, small but very comfortable, beautiful flower center piece in the middle of the restaurant, makes this place very elegant and romantic.\nService was perfect. Parking on the street is easy to find. Went on a Wednesday evening, and the place was maybe 2/3 full. So you could probably walk-in on a weekday, if you liked. Noise level was perfect. Bring a date here!",
      "I don't give out 5 stars very easily but this place deserves it! Service was extraordinary and the food experience was one we will not forget.  Our server was very well educated and did an amazing job helping us with the selections.  Food was divine! Highly recommend you add this to your LA itinerary!"

Fresh ingredients, great taste!\nThey\u2019re organized making the wait very reasonable.\nMy dad had the Verano which was packed with delicious ingredients and I made my own panini. We shared a piece of one of the \u201cpizza\u201d of the day: guanciale. Crispy and yummy!\nThe bread was fresh, crispy on the outside but airy on the inside.\nI\u2019ll definitely go back! Can\u2019t wait to see what my husband thinks!!",

Was so happy to taste some real mortadella which is difficult to find. I also had some pastries and they were good. Even the vibe is Italian - maybe that\u2019s why service is slow \ud83d\ude04You\u2019re gonna have to wait at least 20 miles for your focaccia- we were fine with that as it was Sunday. \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b",
      "I was looking to get a dairy-free sandwich while waiting for my tires to get replaced down the street and decided to try out this restaurant.  Luckily, they had a vegan option called the Fiorella which was made of roasted veggies, arugula and pistachios.  I'm not sure I ever need to eat a sandwich with meat in it after this.  It was delicious!  The bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the sandwich was flavorful overall.\n\nThis is now probably my favorite sandwich in LA.",
      "I stopped by for a slice of pizza which is actually a great slice of focaccia with topping. Flavorful in a simple way with fresh ingredients, the way Italian food is served in Italy. I will be back to try their salads & sandwiches. So many good options for lunch!",
      "This place is a taste of Italy. Think of entering a sandwich shop in  Florence, Rome and or Milan.\n\nThe service is impeccable.\nAnd any of their sandwiches are high quality. Seriously you just cannot go wrong."

      "NORMA is a culinary gem that deserves all the praise it receives. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere, and the attentive staff made me feel right at home, ensuring that every detail of my dining experience was taken care of. The menu at NORMA is a masterpiece, curated by Executive Chef Jason Fullilove, with standout dishes like the sourdough flatbread topped with whipped ricotta and caramelized honey, the hot fried 1/2 chicken with a ginger spice blend, and the dry-aged sea bass paired with forbidden black rice and pickled market veggies. The desserts were a sweet symphony of flavors, including the vegan stone fruit clafoutis and the cast iron cookie. NORMA's commitment to accommodating dietary restrictions and allergies was impressive, and the 18% gratuity added to the bill was a fair acknowledgment of the outstanding service received. If you're looking for a dining experience that combines exceptional food, impeccable service, and a welcoming ambiance, NORMA is the place to go. Treat yourself to a culinary adventure at NORMA, and prepare to be amazed.",

Husband really liked the Wagyu strip loin but know there\u2019s not a lot of bells and whistles on that dish- just straightforward meat lol. Service was great as well.",
      "I had a really amazing time at Norma! I went with two other friends and we shared the steak frites, amazing curried cauliflower agnolotti, the carrot and broccoli appetizers, the salmon entree, and biscuits. Very fresh food and generous portions - the steak and agnolotti definitely stood out as the best. They had cute cocktails and mocktails and really nice bartenders and servers. The atmosphere and decor were great - we had no trouble hearing each other but it was lively and fun and seems like it becomes more of a lounge later at night. Awesome neighborhood spot and I can\u2019t wait to go back!",
      "Norma is such a cute spot with really nice decor and amazing food. We were a group of friends who went there for dinner and shared plates and everything we had was so tasty, including the cocktails. I especially liked the octopus, probably some of the best I\u2019ve had. This place could be the perfect date spot but it also looked like they have a private area you can reserve for an event too. Will definitely be coming back!",

      "So delicious! The borscht, potato dumplings, and stroganoff were so delicious. The vodka flight is a must. Huge portions on the food and drinks.",
      "Wonderful first time experience.  The seating is great, as it's half open air.  The home made infused vodka is so smooth.  The borscht and golubtsy are fantastic.  I can't wait to come back.",
      "I wasn't sure what to expect when we decided to dine here. What a wonderful experience. Our service was so kind explaining the food and vodka. The Sturgeon was very tasty. Cooked medium as it can get tough, ours was juicy & flakey. The dumplings were a fun tastey treat. Now the salad was a taste bud explosion! Full of fresh herbs & the garlic dressing was delicious. The vodka tasting was fun. This is a must visit place! BTW there is a nice little market next door where you can pick up some Ukrainian/Russian treats. Parking was easy with a lot attached with plenty of spots.",
      "I have been to Traktir a few times now and have never been disappointed. They infused their own vodka in-house and it was amazing. The service is great friendly and attentive but not overbearing. The food is phenomenal. I would highly recommend trying Traktir out if you have never been there and want a new experience.",
      "My wife and I were ignored tonight.  Having lived here our entire lives we thought this restaurant would be nice to try.  Charming inside and we had selected many expensive items off the menu.  We were not even given water and no one even looked in our direction so we could order.  Having lived here for over 50 years this was a big disappointment."

      "Lovely ambiance in the courtyard! Tapas style French food that has a comfy yet elevated touch. The fingerling potatoes are a delicious cheesy mess that was creamy yet light. Highlight of the night! Really enjoyed the salads and Spanish Fried Chicken too. Service was on top of things and very attentive. Very California vibes and feel. Good space for a smaller group or a date night too.",
      "Came here with two friends for Dine LA! First time being here. It was great. The food is so tasty, the chicken was juicy even though it was breaded. The portions are large, even though they may appear small. The wait staff are very attentive. Overall, it was a seamless experience with great food, ambient lighting and a cute outdoor porch area. Great date night place as well. I don\u2019t drink alcohol however they do have an array of cocktails and a very extensive wine list.",
      "We enjoyed a nice dinner during our visit to LA. The focaccia was delicious and had a perfect crust. I ordered the fried chicken and it was so tender and juicy. The portion sizes are smaller and meant for sharing. We ended up being quite full after our meal. The food was very good, but didn\u2019t blow us away. All very simple and fresh, so can\u2019t complain! The restaurant itself is very nice and great for a nice dinner.",
      "The patio is lovely. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The cocktails were inventive, the favorite was the Basil Smash.\nThe food: The Farmer\u2019s Plate - will come back for this, so good. Could be a meal.\nCherry Salad was not plated to share, awkward to eat, do not recommend\nRoasted Chicken is a large portion, but again the pieces were big and hard to share - very tasty though\nSugar snap peas, english peas, pea tendrils - Very few peas, mostly tendrils and these were  tough and chewy. Don't order",
      "I have stopped in to this branch on a few occasions. All were great. I like being seated on the covered patio the most and the Spanish fried chicken is delicious."

      "We came here this year again for celebrate birthday. Beautiful interior and exterior decoration with plants. Great place with tasty foods. The lamb chops is so delicious ever!! Yellowtail tuna tartare would be better with something crunchy with lettuce. The foods are so exceptional. The service is also good. The vibe is cozy and pleasant. We loved everything that we ordered. Definitely we will come back again!",
      "Such a beautiful place, loved their ambiance. We went there last Friday for small plates and drinks. Their risotto and hazelnut bar were soo good. Drinks were also amazing. Server took more than 15 minutes to take our order initially but once they came, service was really good.",
      "The overall ambience of Ardor was exceptional. Food wise, the steak and eggs really stood out to me. The yellowtail tar tar would be better with plantain chips or something crunchy rather than lettuce. The oysters and the onion rings were delightful. The pasta on the brunch menu was okay, as well as the eggs benedict. Our dessert which was the cheesecake and churro waffle were amazing. Our server was super attentive and made sure every need was met.",
      "I\u2019ve had the good fortune to visit Ardor twice this year. Most recently for an elegant Christmas dinner with good friends. It was a limited menu ( not the full dinner menu) and still delightful!\n\nDrink: Chili - their version of an old fashion. Delightful and ever so slightly sweet.\n\nFood:\nMilk Buns - perfectly light and rich\nKing Crab tagliatelle- never disappoints and a favorite every time!\nWagyu beef with various salts - every bite was delicious!!\nCrispy Brussel side - refreshing with the savory dishes\nBraised short ribs - very good but was hoping for more complex flavor\nChestnut ravioli with truffle - it was OK. Would not order again.\n\nOn previous occasion other standout dishes were:\nCharred Oyster Mushrooms - delish!\nCauliflower Cacio e Pepe - delish!",
      "Earthy atmosphere,  surrounded by greenery.  There is indoor & patio seating.  All the food was delicious, fresh.  I had the sweet potato curry, tasted the salmon, and branzino...The milk bread is Soo delicious, too.   Also enjoyed the key lime pie !!!"

      "Always amazing! I love coming here while visiting LA. I feel like the food is always the same which is huge. The only thing with the service this time was it was too many times asking us if things were okay. I almost couldn\u2019t enjoy conversation with my friend because of it. Otherwise I highly recommend for the great food and loved sitting outside.",
      "Great sushi and cocktails! There were six of us so we chose the Izakaya feast - curated sushi from all three in-house kitchens and they included the respective chefs' choices. Everything was delicious!\nThe only drawback was the wait time before we got a table. We did have a reservation but had to wait an hour before being seated.",

      "I went here with my girlfriend on Valentine\u2019s Day and we both loved it. The nice dark atmosphere the restaurant has gives a really good dinner vibe. We started off with 2 cocktails and loved them. We got the fresh oysters and miso soup as an appetizer. We really loved both of them. The miso soup was so tasty. For our main dish we both got the surf and turf and loved it. This place is definitely a must try.",
      "Beautiful building/interior.\nHeat lamps by the tables outside. Good sushi, tasted fresh. Loved the eggplant app.\nGood service.\n\nLots of steps to get up to the restaurant, I don't know if they have an elevator available. We ate dinner outside and it was a vibe, and nice to enjoy the LA scenery."

      "Absolutely delicious. Everything tasted fresh and appropriately spicy when ordered Thai spicy. We had the crispy rice salad with sour pork and it was crunchy, flavorful and sour. The sai ua was full of herbs and grilled perfectly, served with a fire nam prik. We also shared the pastrami pad kee mao and it was great. The pastrami works well with the noodles and basil and I always love a green peppercorn! Will have to be back.\n\nSide note - cute interior!",
      "One of the best Thai food places I\u2019ve ever been to. The noodles with pastrami were amazing but pretty spicy. Service and vibes were great as well! Everything here is fresh and delicious! I wish I lived closer so I could visit more often!",
      "Went here for my birthday dinner with friends and it was a good experience overall. I had fun. Parking can be tough - street parking. The food was okay. It was definitely flavorful, it didn\u2019t taste bad and the service was great, the employees were welcoming and patient and the food came out fast. I loved the location of the restaurant, towards the end of sunset strip before it goes into the Beverly Hills area. It\u2019s a trendy and colorful place and has a casual feel to it. I\u2019ve had better pad Thai - this pad Thai tastes pretty average. Which isn\u2019t bad! It definitely tastes right and the chicken on both the pad see ew and pad Thai were great. The sweet potato curry didn\u2019t taste like sweet potato and more like regular potatoes but paired well with rice. The crab wontons were the best - they were super delectable and I liked that it sat on a bed of vegetables. Flavor is heavy in general as is with all Thai food, lots of sauce and heavy seasoning but I guess that\u2019s what makes it good. Wouldn\u2019t go for Thai if you\u2019re health conscious but once a week dining out can be okay. The sweets were sweet and satisfied my sweet tooth and the mangoes were incredibly fresh and sweet. It was good experience overall though! I rated it three stars because I think the food was pretty average and didn\u2019t blow my mind and the price is regular pricing you see at a typical restaurant in LA.",
      "This place is great\u2026.  just not the same when they aren\u2019t offering the hidden treasures :( so if you\u2019re thinking about getting it tonight they don\u2019t have it. Also the blonde waitress did not give out welcoming vibes. She was very cold and never smiled . Never asked  came back to check on us. It\u2019s really sad because I love this place but not sure I would come back because of the service by her."

The eclectic decor added to the vibrant ambiance, making every moment feel like a journey through time.\n\nBut it wasn't just the ambiance that impressed us; the service was exceptional. Both our server and the server in training were incredibly attentive and sweet, ensuring that our dining experience was nothing short of wonderful. They were knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations, enhancing our meal even further.\n\nAnd let's talk about the food \u2013 it was simply delicious! The tuna melt was perfectly grilled with a generous amount of flavorful tuna and melted cheese. The Caesar salad was fresh and crisp, and the breakfast burrito was a hearty and satisfying choice.\n\nOverall, Barney\u2019s Beanery offers not only fantastic food but also a delightful atmosphere and outstanding service. It's a place where you can enjoy a meal with friends or family while basking in the nostalgia of yesteryears. Five stars without a doubt!",

      "Old time bar where Jim Morrison apparently came in for the odd drink and Janis Joplin had her last meal. In a really cool spot in Hollywood with equally cool people.

The pricing for drinks are very good. There is a karaoke night on Wednesday which is interesting. Def a overall good hang out with friends or even a date. The location is ideal as it\u2019s in a prime Weho location. It\u2019s a locals spot so def pop in when you get a chance. It\u2019s casual so don\u2019t overthink it. have fun"

      "If you are anywhere in Los Angeles or on a vacation this is a must stop and a hidden gem in West Hollywood. You will have the best Italian food in all of Hollywood and maybe the City. There is not one thing wrong with this place. It is perfect. You will be in heaven. You will be calm and relaxed while served by the best staff and the owner is cute as a button, and Italian.\n\nIt was concert night for Buddy, my grandson, and I and we were in search of a new fine dining restaurant. We were driving down Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood and Buddy sees this little tiny Brown building and says let's look. He sure knows how to pick them. Turns out to be an Italian restaurant with everything made from scratch, no preservatives, no sugar, just amazing food. They even make their own bread.\n\nWe walked in, parking is on the street and they might have valet at night, I don't know. We were the first ones there. They were not even open yet, but we did not know and we walked in. The sweetest, most adorable young man asked us where we would like to sit. The place is so pretty, but small. We told him to put us where ever he wanted. We were starting to realize the place was just about to open. The waiter took us upstairs to the most wonderful table near a window. He asked what we might want to drink and gave us menus. Their menu is not huge. Again, they make everything from scratch.\n\nWe were brought warm Italian bread and it was so great. I asked about it and they make it right there as they do everything. It was amazing.\n\nFor entrees we had ravioli and a wonderful pasta filled with shrimp, clams and mussels in a red sauce. It was so great, my grandson was \"sharing\" my food. Again, all made there, to order, by scratch.\n\nFor dessert we had the best Tiramisu I have ever had in my life.\n\nAs the place began to fill I could see wonderful dishes going by. The waiter was kind to my grandson and gave us all the time we wanted. It was just a wow experience and I have been to most of the Italian places in Hollywood. I can't wait to bring my husband. He is going to love it.\n\nOn the way down the stairs an adorable man took my check and card. It turned out he is the owner. He is Italian and all of these receipts are his. I think he might have \"borrowed\" a little from his grandmother and mother and added some of his own. I could tell he loved his little fine dinning place. He was so sweet--photo attached.\n\nYou must go there. You just must."

Our server was knowledge, pleasant and very helpful. We look forward to returning to try more dishes. The donut dessert is worth the wait,!!",
      "I have been to this place before and I don\u2019t understand why they had to change or modify their menu. Ceviche was flavorless, the onions were bitter and the leche de tigre was not made properly. The saltado wasn\u2019t saltado. No char on any of the ingredients, filet was overcooked and barely any onions and instead of fries, they had boiled purple potatoes? Had to send it back. Then we ordered the short rib, and it was not soft as it should be. It was more like BBQ ribs and not braised\u2026The beet salad was amazing and the beef heart (anticucho) was pretty good, but I paid over $300 for a disappointing experience. Don\u2019t mess with the classics. Especially when Peruvian cuisine is in the spotlight.",
      "As a Peruvian I gotta say\u2026 Approved!\nThe dishes aren\u2019t your typical Peruvian dishes. They are gourmet. Prices are a little high but the quality of the food justifies the price. I will go back!",
      "Wow. This place is incredible. We had the octopus, branzino and for a starter the cod/potato starter. Everything hit the spot. Do eat all of the sauces that come with each dish. I was floored by the wasabi/mustard sauce on the side of the appetizer. And there\u2019s a special tomato/olive confit on the potatoes of the octopus that is spicy and just, so so good. The drinks were amazing too - everything is so smooth. Highly recommend chicha gin fiz. This place is also beautiful and amazing that I\u2019m actually writing the review in the restaurant, which is a first. Thanks for a great meal, chefs at Rosaline!",
      "Tomahawk steak. Enough said. I also had their paella , and it was incredibly stellar. The shrimp, the sauce, crispy burned edges, this place didn't disappoint. The service was incredible, the second you walk in. The inside is dimly lit with just enough light to set a romantic atmosphere and a vibe that makes you want to stay longer than you anticipated."

      "Best pizza in town for sure. Pizza is a sensitive issue because it is very difficult to find an authentic pizza with ingredients that are fresh. Ingredients used in this unique pizza are from Italy. I love the design of the place. The colors used and the whole vibe is just perfect. I will come back.",
      "Food was great. Modern twists on classic flavors. Service is great too. They take reservations which is nice.",
      "Tried Pizzana for the first time in Hollywood as we were visiting from OC for the day.  we saw the place in istagram which claimed to have the best Pizza in LA and decided to give it a try.  I was only me and my wifey for this dinner, and we stopped by their location around 5:30 to see if it is busy and whether we needed a reservation.  They told us to better reserve a spot just in case.  When we showed up an hour later, we were the only patrons, but by 8PM there were a couple of other parties that came in.  The location is very small.  You can see their kitchen from the street.  The have about 3-4 tables inside right where the kitchen is visible and where all the take out hussle happens and about 10 tables of 2 outside in an alley that has been converted to an indoor seating area, which is super dark and I guess romantic?  They have seat lamps and the roof is covered but not with a real roof but you are semi warm and if it is rainy there is no danger of getting wet.  Their menu is fairly simple, and it is on a paper place mat.  They have a few options for starters, 4 salad options, and about a dozen pizza options.  We decided to try their brussel sprouts salad (18), Chopped salad (20) and their Neo Margherita Pizza (24).  Salads came out fairly quickly.  I was kinda disappointed by the size given the price, but they were both tasty.  The Chopped salad is light and doesnt have too much salami or cheese which is the way I like.  The brussel sprout salad is mostly lettuce with grated brussel sprouts on top but has yummy pistacchios and it was a big hit with my wife.\nThe star of the show was the Neo Margherita pizza that came out of the oven with just the right amount of chard on the crust.  It is traditional nepotetan thin pizza which is really delicious.  You can definitely taste the san manzano tomatoes and the fresh cheese (which they say it is imported from Italy - fior di latte)....really nice.  It is a 12 inch pizza that come in 6 slices.  Of course I had 4 slices and wifey had 2 LOL.  If I had to pick on anything is that the crust may need a tad bit more salt and oil, as I really enjoy the crust especially the slightly chard ones, but this one was a bit too dry for me, so I have to transfer some of the sauce from the main slice on it to make it edible.\nOverall great food, seems like most of their business is take out and delivery...",
      "Came here for a late dinner and made a reservation for the three of us at 9pm. Metered street parking available. Credit cards accepted. Outdoor seating in an alley with heating as well as indoor seating available. There\u2019s a single occupant restroom in the back (note that you must push pretty firmly to open the door). We ordered the chop salad, carnivoro pizza, Bianca pizza, and vodka pasta. Everything was tasty and I particularly enjoyed the texture of the pasta. The chop salad was hearty and a good starter if you\u2019re hungry. I preferred the carnivoro over the Bianca but enjoyed both. We had a few slices leftover that kept well for the following day.",
      "We had the broccolini and fried cauliflower for appetizers, and three different pizzas. The appetizers tasted good. The pizzas are all pretty personal size - sliced into six, good for sharing as well. The pizzas were delectable and full of original flavor, it was warm and fresh. The wait for the pizzas was a bit long, but we had the appetizers beforehand. The pizzas are decent but the crusts were fairly burnt \u2014 hence the three stars, but if you don\u2019t mind burnt pizza crust then it shouldn\u2019t be a big problem! The burnt crust  could also be because the oven was burnt before hand and not scraped before. The restaurant has a pleasing architecture to it and is very trendy. Good place to come for lunch and dinner!"

      "One of the best meals we\u2019ve ever had! Highly recommend! Everything we had was delicious!\n\nOxtail dumplings\nBalsamic glazed ribs\nSingaporean chili crab cake\nFried cauliflower\nMaitake mushrooms\nLamb shank\nHanger steak\n\nOur server Brad was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We were sad we were too full to get dessert.",
      "We had a phenomenal experience here. Service and food were spectacular and I cannot wait to return!\n\nCrudo, peach & buratta salad, roasted half chicken, mushrooms, gnocchi, and the strawberry ricotta dessert--holy mother of god every single dish was consistently good.\n\nOur server and everyone who touched the table were lovely. They really set themselves apart with both special food and special service.\n\nReally looking forward to returning.",
      "If I could have had more off the menu I would have done, but I don't think my waistline would have been best pleased. Really great variety of dishes to cater for a myriad of different tastes. Mostly small plates to share on the table (which I love as you get to try a bit of everything) wonderful industrial feel to the place as well. Staff were helpful and gave us good advice for selections off the menu. We'll just have to visit again sometime to try the other dishes.",
      "Really enjoyed our meal here. The English peas served edamame style was our favorite app. We also enjoyed the hangar steak and the shellfish pot. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful. The dishes are meant to be shared so go with folks who like to eat. All in all a fun date night out.",
      "Went on a date to celebrate getting a new job. We had the oxtail dumplings, ricotta gnocchi, eggplant, fried cauliflower, the venison loin, and the toffee pudding. The experience as a whole was fantastic. It truly felt like an artistic experience as much as a culinary one. The food was delicious and the menu is so carefully crafted for fall. The staff is top tier and are professionals without question. Definitely a life-enhancing experience and I will be back!"

      "Food and atmosphere were both exceptional. Brenda was our server and she was very attentive and professional. Would recommend to anyone looking for good quality seafood! Chilean Sea Bass and the Scallops were seared and cooked perfectly.",
      "My wife and I were staying in a hotel in Santa Monica on July 4th, 2024 and we were looking for a good seafood restaurant. I found this place on Google and saw it had over 2000 really good reviews and the concierge at our hotel also recommended it, so I made a reservation and we tried it.  When we arrived, the place was packed and there was a line of people waiting to be seated. We were seated within 5 minutes after letting them know we had a reservation.  Andre was our server and the guy was excellent. We asked about some of the items on the menu and he answered all our questions.  We started out with the Spanish Octopus and a few Margarita\u2019s.  The Octopus was fantastic, but be aware, you are only going to get one arm of the octopus which is common in every restaurant.  After I took one bite, I wished there were 8 arms on that plate!  The Chilean sea bass was hands down the best we have ever had and the portion size was great.\n\nThis place is on the higher end and the bill reflects that, but we didn\u2019t have a single complaint about this restaurant, the food or the staff.  The bill was $194 before tip for two of us.  We would definitely dine here again if in the area.  I highly recommend this place if you\u2019re looking for good seafood.\n\nAll the staff we interacted with were friendly and seemed very happy to be working there.",
      "Absolutely amazing place; not only were the staff super friendly, knowledgeable and punctual, the food and drinks were top notch. I personally enjoyed the platter and my wife had the king Salmon. Would definitely recommend to others and would love to visit again",
      "We had an exceptional dining experience at this restaurant! The food was simply outstanding, with every dish bursting with rich and delicious flavors. The environment was equally impressive, offering a warm and inviting ambiance that made our meal even more enjoyable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for great food in a lovely setting!",
      "Stopped by to treat my newlywed wife for her birthday during our honeymoon. While we couldn't get a table they offered us high top seating at the bar which was fine for us. We ordered the oyster sampler and the lump crab cake; both of which were amazingly fresh quality. I ended up getting the lobster roll entree and my wife got the fresh grilled fish (I forget what type). The quality of each dish was hands down one of the best I've had. I went with the butter version but in hindsight I would have preferred the mayo version. While the lobster was tender, it could have used something in addition to the bread for it to not be so dry. The fish was tender and flaky. My wife can be picky about fish but she really enjoyed it. They were also nice enough to check with the kitchen about my wife's lactose intolerance, and gave her a non dairy sorbet dessert. Overall I definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants a great meal in a lively atmosphere with great service."

      "Super casual restaurant directly on Santa Monica Pier. Order and pick up at the window. Indoor and outdoor seating. Quite possibly the best clam chowder and bread bowl I\u2019ve ever had. The lobster roll was also excellent. Very highly recommended.",
      "Delicious and fresh.\n\nThe service was friendly, however it did take a bit to get our grilled oysters to us but it did not disappoint and we enjoyed them down on the beach.\n\nAlso get the strawberry lemonade, it tastes like fresh strawberries and it wasn\u2019t super sugary.",
      "Grabbed brunch here on a Sunday Morning.\n\nCute and open air building with plenty of seating inside and out.\n\nService was sufficient. Not to particularly engaging or opinionated regarding the offerings.\n\nWe had picky young adults with us so a seafood place can stress them out.\n\nBurger- was very enjoyable\nFish and Chips 5/5\nFish tacos overall good, could use more sauce.\nCT lobster Roll- hubs really liked it.\nCalamari- could be better, kinda chewy\nOysters on the half shell- Black Magic oysters were so sweet and yummy! However they were still connect to the shell and that\u2019s not typical.\nChocolate chip cookie- just ok",
      "The team there seems tired. They took orders and provided food, but not one person smiled back when I interacted with them. It was a sunny day and was so happy to be outside and being there dampened my mood. That sad vibe translated to the food.\n\nLobster roll:  one word - dry. The bread was so dry I almost choked. I got the New England style and they didn't put a lot of meat in the roll, so 35% was just stale, dry, bread. Also, the fries were cold and tasted like they'd been sitting out for a while\n\nAhi poke: underwhelming with very little flavor and bland, mushy rice\n\nGrilled salmon: best dish we tried and had some flavor. Small portion of fish, overcooked veggies, bland, mushy rice\n\nWe spent $72 on these three items. We won't be in any hurry to return.",
      "i think it was a scam. they charged 16$ for an appetizer size poke. all my friends food portion were really small and not the worth the price. i think everything on the menu are overpriced. with those price you can get a proper lunch or dinner at a restaurant outside the pier. If you\u2019re looking a place to eat dinner, i would recommend to not eat here. but if you are okay with the price, you can try"

      "Story time! My friend was craving a cheese burger and I didn\u2019t know where to find one. A nice security guard let me in on the best burger he\u2019s ever had in his life, and walked me over to The Curious Palate.\nI didn\u2019t know it at the time but the owner was there and working the counter behind the bar. He greeted me and my toddler with warmth and welcomed me in to view the menu before offering suggestions. I placed the order and went chase after my kid on the escalators. My friend came by and went into the restaurant to pick up the burger and ended up staying to enjoy the meal. I came back to find her and her daughter settled at a table sharing fries with house made ketchup.\nThe owner came by to see how we were doing and we found out that all the veggies are sourced from the farmers market and they make their bread in house along with their burger patties. The burger was top notch and we agreed with the security guard about how it may be the best damn burger in town.\nThe restaurant is bright with plenty of space for large families. The bar stools are comfy and invite the urge to sit a while and enjoy the lovely Santa Monica air.\nWill definitely be coming back \ud83d\ude0a",
      "Everything is homemade. The menu offers a delightful variety of dishes, all crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The service was impeccable, with the owner and staff going above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic dining experience.",
      "It\u2019s my first time here and I\u2019m glad I found it! Their Spicy Thai Satay sandwich tasted amazing. Their homemade ketchup also hits different. We also loved their Swordfish sandwich.\nThey were a little understaffed, but they were friendly and the service was quick.",
      "Curious Place has left the best impression!! Great hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentations, and lots of wine selection!! I recommend it to everyone for a great brunch on the weekend!!\nI will definitely go back.\n\nMy second visit was as great as the first time!\nWe even had a small chat with the nice owner and he told us where he gets his fresh produce and is willing to share his recipes",
      "Amazing little place inside the shopping mall! Food is outstanding and service is great. Loved their selection of local draft beer. Great coffee porter. Pea pesto pasta was delicious, light and fresh, with lots of pesto, peas and sun dried tomatoes. Way better than most Italian places. Burger was tasty too, cooked medium and served with well seasoned fries. Definitely recommend!!! \ud83d\ude0b \ud83d\ude0b \ud83d\ude0b"

      "It was a packed night which is a good sign but could also be very interesting with service. We had reservations but there was a little wait which wasn\u2019t that bad. A drink at the bar helps. Once seated, an outside table, our server Anna was amazing. Very attentive to everything and so appreciative as well. Trying to take care of the other tables as well as us. She was a busy bee but got everything done. She and the other guys was able to get us another headlamp as the one that was utilized next to us ended up being turned down when another party requested it not an acknowledging us one bit. And then the nerve to put a jacket on afterwards because it was too cold. But instead of fussing over it, she and one of the other guy moved an unused heater to accommodate our table. Great service. Starters were amazing, fries are always good. Our entree was good as well but more keen on the starters. Great and fast service, Anna was amazing.",
      "The restaurant is really amazing, decor is pretty, not too loud, nice music, and our server Donald was really sweet. Nice service, really paid attention to what we needed and recommended the best for our group. Really appreciate it and will come back when visiting the area.",
      "Anna was great! She was very attentive and friendly! The dine LA course was delicious! Generous portions and very tasty! All-day happy hour is a plus, quality drinks! Highly recommend!",
      "Perfect for a late snack.  Remus was the friendliest and most helpful host we\u2019ve had in ages, and our food (crostini, squash blossom, tagliatelle) hit the bar for excellence.  The mocktail version of the Gooseberry also made my night!",
      "Spent a few days in Santa Monica with a friend and our teenage sons. Wanted to treat them to a nice dinner and 1212 did not disappoint! Food, staff, ambiance, everything was excellent! I had the mushroom risotto, it was the best one I\u2019ve had outside Italy. Lasagna and ravioli were excellent, great wine list too."

The noise level was very high though-we were screaming when we\u2019re talking-so if you are planning a quiet evening atmosphere, that\u2019s not it)) Very lively and loud here. Food and dessert were fantastic! I didn\u2019t like the Freshlove drink, but the second one that Server recommended, smth with Apple, was very yummy!! Def recommend!",
      "I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Penthouse Santa Monica, and it was truly a culinary experience to remember. Perched high above Santa Monica, the restaurant offers breathtaking views of the sunset and the sparkling city below, creating the perfect backdrop for a memorable evening.\n\nTo start off the meal, I ordered the Crispy Rice with a choice of Hawaiian Tuna, Spicy King Salmon, or Truffle Wagyu Steak Tartare, and it was a delightful explosion of flavors and textures. The crispy rice provided the perfect crunch to complement the fresh, tender tuna, and the truffle created a harmonious dish that set the stage for the rest of the meal.\n\nNext, I tried the Greek Style Octopus, and it was nothing short of exceptional. The octopus was cooked to perfection, tender with a slight char, and the flavors of the Mediterranean herbs and spices shone through beautifully. It was delicious and flavorful, leaving me wanting more.\n\nFor the main course, I indulged in the Umami Steak, featuring USDA Prime Flat Iron, Truffle Potato Cloud, Portobello Mushroom, and Umami Sauce. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, incredibly tender, and bursting with savory umami flavors. The accompaniments elevated the dish to another level, and each bite was a symphony of deliciousness.\n\nTo round off the evening on a sweet note, I savored the Profiteroles with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Chocolate Ganache. The profiteroles were light and airy, filled with luscious vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled with decadent chocolate ganache. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n\nOverall, my dining experience at The Penthouse Santa Monica was nothing short of amazing. The food was exquisite, the service was impeccable, and the views were breathtaking. I can't wait to return to this gem of a restaurant and indulge in their culinary delights once again. If you're looking for a dining experience with a view to match, The Penthouse Santa Monica is the place to be.",
      "I had the pleasure of dining at The Penthouse Restaurant for breakfast, and it was an unforgettable experience. The service was amazing, with attentive and friendly staff ensuring everything was perfect. The view from the sky is simply breathtaking, offering a stunning backdrop to a delightful meal.\n\nThe breakfast was delicious, with every dish expertly prepared and bursting with flavor. Even though I only had breakfast here, it was enough to leave a lasting impression. I can't wait to return and try more from their menu.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in Santa Monica!",
      "We came on a Saturday evening without reservation, and were able to get a table quickly. The sunset view can only be seen on one corner. The food was good, but not over the top. We ordered brussel sprouts for appetizer and it was over-cooked too-roasted. The price tags were high and the entree portion size was small. You can get parking validation.",
      "Amazing experience for my sisters birthday. The location is stunning, the service is amazing and food was generous and delicious. The prices are actually reasonable for what you\u2019re getting. Our server Cristina was so sweet and attentive and the rest of the wait staff works so hard to ensure all customers are taken care of. We will definitely be returning."

      "One word... AMAZING..... This was a fantastic and delicious restaurant.   The service was amazing,  the food was spectacular and environment excellent.   The server answered every question we had and was extremely courteous and patient with all our questions.   The food was amazing and I loved the fact that everything was made from scratch in-house.  Come check this place out it is scrumptious.",
      "Great  food, service atmosphere.\nSpicy rigatoni vodka has a great sauce and sausage they use for it was great enough.\nBolognese has strong meat flavor, which I love it and all the pasta were perfectly cooked as al dente.\nTheir meatball was so great the sauce, and creamy polenta was a shock for me, I've never seen but it goes really well.\nAll the servers and host greeted me nicely and it seems the servers are professionals and explained the menu really well.\nDefinitely recommend this place!."

However, my waiter had the personality of a fence post like she was totally miserable then she was replaced by another waiter midway through my dinner. I thought that was kind of weird.

It was a beautiful and comfortable place to sit and eat breakfast while enjoying a view of the ocean shore.\nThe staff who were very attentive greeted us warmly and Carlos helped us with suggestions on what to order.\nI had the scrumptious breakfast pizza topped with a poached egg and washed down with incredibly fresh squeezed orange juice; my wife had the French toast, and my daughter had the crab benedict.\nThen when it came to dessert time, I ordered the blackberry apple crumble, my wife ordered the heavenly key lime pie, and my daughter ordered the cup of berries.\nI had a great conversation with the staff about the history of the restaurant, as well as its beautiful and comfortable atmosphere.\nThis place is definitely worth visiting when you're in the area.",
      "Place was very crowded around the time I came.. Had a reservation but got seated 10-15 minutes later. The presentation of food was great but the taste\u2026 Everything I had including the salad was bland. This was very disappointing because you would think if the food was expensive, it would at least be good. The only thing I would recommend is the fried calamari, fresh pineapple juice, and passion fruit tangerine sorbet. I would not go back, but it is a cute restaurant just for the aesthetic.",
      "Amazing find. We were heading to the Santa Monica pier and our Lyft driver stopped right in front of this spot. We looked inside and could not resist having lunch there. It is an amazing place, a feel like a kick from the 1960s Cuba, rustic elegance with superb service. Definitely a relic from a different time that rises above all of the kitsch of Santa Monica pier. Don\u2019t eat on the pier, spend the bucks and eat here.\n\nThe food is unexpectedly simple and elegant. Not food you will find in other places. And the staff is gracious, patient, accommodating, and grateful. They have been trained extraordinarily well, and everyone knows their job and does it without prompting.\n\nThe decor is fascinating, vibrant, engaging, entertaining. Fresh roses at every table. A place one could sit and appreciate for hours. Never been to a place like this. Music was a bit odd - recording of female vocalist doing anything from Billy Joel to Carole King to Deep Purple. That\u2019s the only thing that didn\u2019t quite fit. On the other hand, maybe it\u2019s just the quirk this fabulous spot needs.\n\nThis is a place you DO NOT want to pass up. Worth every penny and the time spent.",
      "Passed by this restaurant and decided to have dinner here. The staff was very nice and fast. Food was good, we had fried calamari and drinks (espresso martini and margarita), but nothing exceptional. The restaurant is in a great location, placed right on the other side of the road from the Santa Monica pier. I would recommend it as it was a nice place to eat, but be prepared to pay a bit more (2 portions and 3 drinks ca 160$)",
      "Another amazing dining experience at Ivy at the Shore. The seafood platter was a sumptuous appetizer, and the sea bass, grilled salmon, and lobster ravioli were savory and satisfying. And, of course, the staff, as always, was gracious, attentive, and accommodating!"

      "Really good food. Reservation highly suggested. Went for breakfast and the whole menu was open for ordering. Ending up getting the breakfast sandwich which was good but really just a nicer version of an ordinary breakfast sandwich. Had a taste of the polenta and that was nice too \u2014 different. I can\u2019t forget the whipped eggplant \u2014 delicious! And with the bread is so good! Coffee tasted well. Lastly, our server Tony was very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. We appreciated his service. This place is one part hype and another part really good at what it does.",
      "Delicious food and drinks in a beautiful spot with great views. Loved the gem lettuce salad, the whipped eggplant, the vocdka sauce pasta and the truffle pasta. The tequila/mezcal cocktails are delicious! Service was decent, considering how packed it was for a mid afternoon on a Wednesday! Will definitely be back.",
      "Beautiful views and exceptional views! The entrance to this amazing restaurant does not give any clue as to the amazing view once you arrive to the seating area! Watching the sunset as you dine, I could stay here for hours just enjoying the vibe and the food! My daughter recommended this restaurant and it did not disappoint! Can't wait til I'm back in LA again to try another awesome dish!",
      "This was a disappointing first and last experience. We made reservations for the \u201csunset room,\u201d but were seated in a corner by the kitchen doors and cappuccino maker. I asked if we could be seated in the main area and was told there were no seats for a party of 2. We watched as half a dozen parties of 2 were seated within the main area (including at tables for 4 and a party that had no reservation). It set such a negative tone for the dining experience.\n\nInstead of enjoying the lovely views and open air, we had every dirty plate pass by us, listened to the constant stacking of plates, and had the kitchen doors swinging open behind us. We ate our food as quickly as possible and left. I cannot imagine seating someone in this seat unless as a last resort. As a first time patron, I would never go back after this\u2014despite finding the food good.\n\nIf you\u2019re intent on going, I\u2019d recommend the cactus room or a larger party to avoid the same experience. Apparently even when 80% of the dining room is open, they\u2019ll still shove you in a corner.",
      "Great ambience and people watching, especially when the weather is nice.\n\nDelicious Mediterranean food - specifically the sopresata pizza, the whipped eggplant, and the meatballs. Also, perfect for sharing with others in your party.\n\nHighly recommend if you\u2019re looking to bring guests/out-of-towners to Santa Monica."

      "I have been to here for brunch twice and really enjoyed it both times. Service and ambiance were great too. We had the pancakes, cinnamon roll, burrito and the acai bowl. All were very good. I highly recommend if you want to go for a nice brunch with family. The eggs Benedict was amazing too.",
      "I had very high expectations when I finally decided to go here for brunch. From the pictures the food looked phenomenal, unfortunately both dishes I ordered were underwhelming. I might have to go back and try some other items or possibly the dinner menu. But as of now they left me unimpressed. The atmosphere was phenomenal and the service was fantastic. the venue is at the Fairmont so it\u2019s quite a pleasurable experience being surrounded by the aesthetics. I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict, and the lemon ricotta pancakes. Neither of them matched up to the price tag, and felt like they were missing that \u201csomething special.\u201d Spent upwards of $100 total for these two dishes. Hopefully the next visit impresses.",
      "This is the 2nd time I have been here. Dinner was great!  It was a slow Saturday night. One of the specials was Shishito peppers. Normally not spicy but man did we get all the hot peppers. Oysters were very small but very good. Cucumber mint mocktail was lovely. The filet was cooked perfectly. The butternut squash pasta was divine. Wedge salad was unique. The sorbet was disappointing.\n\nOur server and the staff were very attentive and kind.",

      "A California Style Mediterranean Restaurant, the menu ingredients fuse Mediterranean Cuisine with Asian Cuisine. Happy Hour is the best time to go 50% off. My favorite dishes are the Southeast Asian inspired Beef Tartar with Tapioca Waffer, similar texture as a Chinese Shrimp Chip. The Branzino is the best entr\u00e9e, Roasted crispy skin. Every few minutes you'll see Flaming Saganaki Served at a neighboring tables."

      "I visit Santa Monica dozens of times a year and have been noticing this restaurant for a while. Today, I took some time to try it out, and the aged steak was excellent. The restaurant has a classic decor style, with brown as the main color, which I quite like. The street-facing tables are open-air, offering a pleasant view of the beach and a refreshing sea breeze. The steak quality is outstanding, highly recommended!",
      "Food, AMAZING! Service, AMAZING! Kelli\u2026 EXTRA AMAZING!!!\n\nMy husband and I celebrated our four year anniversary here and in all the time we\u2019ve been together, we have not had food as outstanding as this! If you haven\u2019t been, GO! And as for Kelli. She is an absolute delight!!",
      "Made reservations here so unsure if you can just walk in, but if you can, I would recommend still making a reservation as this place is near the beach, and it can get really cold at night.\n\nThe server we received gave superb service, from knowing how to recommend dishes, giving a pretty accurate description of portion sizes and what to expect as well as not trying to upsell any dishes.\n\nWhen asked about the specials and what was on hand for their dry aged, she was really knowledgeable about the menu itself, it really showed great professional expertise. On top, she did not give off the vibe of a overly fancy server, but rather one where you can casually talk to, which in turn provided a pleasant experience.\n\nEvery dish that was ordered was either good or surprisingly good. Some of the items, such as the make it yourself charcuterie board, we had no idea what to actually select. Our server helped walk through each option as well as provided her own input on what she likes the best (hint it's not always the expensive options).\n\nI would say, this place is a great place for special occasions or sometimes a place where you just want to treat yourself a little more.",
      "Best restaurant ever!!!! I been coming here for years now and the food is outstanding\u2026 I never had one single thing wrong. Staff is so nice and friendly too. I wish this place is closer to me.",
      "This restaurant was excellent! The atmosphere, establishment, staff and hospitality was excellent! You must try their aged steaks. Seasoned to perfection. Hands down to our waiter! He added perfection to my birthday! Thank you guys!"

      "Amazing food. Different menu choices from your normal breakfast spot. Healthy food options, as well as some of the traditional breakfast items. No kids menu, but they do have half portion options. The food quality was amazing. Super fresh. The portion sizes were decent, BUT they were very hearty and I ended up full. Atmosphere was ok, just like any other cafe. They have espresso coffees as well. I got a latte and it was amazing. So rich and smooth. Service was super fast and food came out looking like an upscale restaurant. I will definitely be coming back.",
      "This place is so cute. The atmosphere was great. The food was delish. I had the bacon crepe - highly recommend. The zucchini hash was different but we still liked it.",
      "Nice food, nice atmosphere. Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s kind of vibe with the blue everything, including the interior design and background music.\n\nWe arrived around 12 PM and didn\u2019t have to wait. We were seated inside.",
      "We decided to try Blue Daisy after walking several blocks in search of a traditional breakfast spot. Historically, whenever we've driven by Blue Daisy, it's been packed. However, since it was a mid-morning on a weekday, there was nearly no wait. We were promptly seated and chose to sit inside as the sun was directly shining on the outdoor seating area, making it less comfortable than usual. To our surprise, the interior was larger than we had anticipated. There was a beautifully decorated room in the back hosting a larger party, which had an ethereal quality.\n\nInside the main dining area where we were seated, there were various seating options, including a bar. The restaurant offers a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, juices, and handcrafted caffeinated drinks.\n\nThe menu at Blue Daisy is not your typical breakfast menu. The options appeared to be freshly sourced and uniquely-prepared. My guest and I opted for safer choices: a Nutella, strawberry, and banana cr\u00eape, and a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes. Both dishes were delightful. We also ordered a side of sausage and bacon. The bacon was perfectly crispy without being greasy and the sausage patty had a slight kick to it, making it equally tasty.\n\nMy guest ordered a drink called the Sunrise (I think), a combination of several juices with a touch of mint, which was refreshing and delicious once she added some raw sugar to it. I chose a mocha, which was only served hot and arrived in a cute little cup with a beautiful design on top. While it was more coffee than mocha and not to my liking, it was beautifully presented. I ultimately opted for a different type of drink that also had fresh mint in it, that was much better and definitely refreshing.\n\nThe service was good and it appeared as though people go regularly, there was a sense of community, connection and camaraderie amongst those that work there & their guests. Personally, that's always refreshing to see.\n\nOverall, our experience was good and we can't wait to go back.",
      "This place is a must-must-must-try! Every time I'm in the area, I\u2019ll stop by for brunch, and it never disappoints. No matter what you order, you have to try the zucchini hash. It's amazing!"

      "Four years ago, we were traveling for a conference, and this place made an impact on me in the middle of the pandemic. Despite the craziness and ridiculous California rules all around the beach. Such as not being able to use a PUBLIC restroom! My sister and I, along with my toddler, drove around what seemed like an eternity looking for a restroom that wasn't closed or that didn't require a reservation from a restaurant. We took so long to find one that we got hungry. We stopped here to try our luck with the bathrooms, and luckily, the restaurant was open and had outdoor seating available. We were overjoyed to find this awesome spot! After relieving ourselves, we excitedly ordered the salmon and burger. They were the best meal we've had in years in the area. We made a vow to come back, and we've been back regularly when in the area ever since. I can't believe I didn't write this review sooner! Thank you to your friendly staff and awesome cooks. Can't wait to be back again.",
      "Great atmosphere. Fairly solid food quality. A bit pricey but it's on the beach.\n\nUsed to come here with Ken D and get the Fred's Salad. After his passing, now come here with my own family. Love to continue his tradition.",
      "It wasnt my first time but usually didnt feel like sharing experience as it seems like everyone is happy enough . but today it was different, Young Hostess was polite and sweet , gave 30 mins walk-in wait on Saturday and they sat me on time , greeted by lovely Rona ( if i spelled it right ) , i ordered immediately ( Mushroom burger + Beer ) and received it in less than 15 minutes . Staff is friendly.. over all peaceful, lovely experience..",
      "Loved this place and will definitely be back. They said the wait was going to be 20 minutes but they got us in after about less than 5 minutes lol\n\nFood, drinks and atmosphere was amazing. Great views and loved the little playground next door for my toddler to burn off some energy. Such good vibes!",
      "If it weren't for the fact that this place is right on the beach I don't know if it would be as popular. The service is incredibly slow (though the servers are friendly and nice) and they get super overwhelmed easily. Food is decent. Best thing is really that it's right next to Annenberg community center and of course right on the beach."

      "This was truly one the very best Italian restaurants that I\u2019ve eaten in. We were seated by the bar and it was a great view to watch the chefs at work.\n\nWe tried the tasting menu for 2 and each dish was just remarkable. We were served with 3 different kinds of pasta that were cooked for 2 and split into 2 plates for us. With that we got one appetizer and a desert to share as well.\n\nMy favorite was the tagliatelle cooked in white truffle butter, but honestly it\u2019s hard to pick a favorite cause everything just exceeded our expectations by a mile.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place to try out authentic Italian pasta.",
      "To say this place has ruin any other pasta place we had in the past is an understatement.\n\nI want to start off by listing a few things I appreciate about the establishment.\n\n1. First come, first serve. No reservations. Allows the customers to possibly dine in sooner rather than waitlisted due to prior booked reservations.\n\n2. Location is small but it\u2019s quaint and gives a more personal vibe with the bar seating and open kitchen concept. I enjoyed seeing how the dishes were made.\n\n3. The staff from the host to the servers to the chefs are amazing. They were all friendly and work diligently. The flow of the front staff to the kitchen never skipped a beat.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about food! Uovo offers a simple menu so if you want a lot of fancy things like other places, this place might throw you off as they keep it very straightforward and simple.\n\nTheir pasta is fresh and flown in overnight from Italy. Every plate we had was perfection. Perfectly cooked al dente pasta where the chew leaves you lingering for the next one. The plates are shareable for 2 people; covers a good 2-3 bites.\n\nWhat we had\u2026\n\n1. Truffle tagliatelle (special of the night) : the truffle was not overpowering, every strand of pasta was blended with the cheese and truffle. Ever wish you can be a judge on those cooking shows and enjoy those amazing dishes? Well, this dish made me felt like I was a judge the whole time and I was raving how freaking delicious it is.\n\n2. Rag\u00fa:  tagliatelle pasta with the best bolognese we had in a very long time. The bolognese tasted as if it\u2019s been simmering for days on end, maybe it has because one bite in and I didn\u2019t want to share it with my boyfriend. It\u2019s a mix of beef and pork with so many familiar aromatics. Warning, this bolognese sticks to the classic; no cheese, no cream. The only way to eat bolognese in my opinion.\n\n3. Caico e Pepe:  I lean towards the red sauce pastas but holy cow this dish is something you want to slap someone for. The chef swirls the pasta around on a pecorino cheese wheel (I really appreciate not burning any alcohol with the cheese) and top it off with more pecorino and black pepper. We were in awe and speechless.\n\n4. Insalata Arugula & Mizuna: tossed and dressed perfectly. Fully enjoyed the hearts of palm and almonds with this salad. A lot of textures and flavors.\n\n5. Tiramisu al cucchiaio:  we love tiramisu but to find a good one is harder than you think. Uovo serves up one in a glass but it\u2019s good! The mascarpone, the espresso and everything in between. And it has hazelnut so enough said.",
      "Absolutely loved the food and experience at Uovo! We went with the classic set and we savored every single bite. The pasta was fresh, flavorful, and delicious. We will definitely be coming back to try the other sets! :)",
      "Really really good pasta.  They're schtick is that they fly the pasta in fresh everyday from Italy.  They claim to be the only place that does that.\n\nCaciao de pepe was delish. Ragu was delish. Clam (vingolese) was pretty good. Can't remember the name of the fourth one we had; think it was a pomodoro (?) and it was super delish.\n\nSmall space, so I can see it getting crowded or a lineup during busy times.  We went for a weekday lunch and there was lots of room.\n\nWould highly recommend if in the area.",
      "Let me start by saying that Uovo is worth the wait! We showed up without a reservation for our party of three and had to put our name down. The wait was around 30 minutes, but it gave us time to chat and get excited for the deliciousness to come.\n\nThe atmosphere is undeniably intimate. The dim lighting and the candles at each table set a romantic scene. It felt energetic and lively, perfect for a date night, but it was also a bit crowded and felt a bit cramped.\n\nThe menu offers two options: a tasting menu for sharing and an a la carte menu. Here's the kicker \u2013 the tasting menus serves two people each, so if you're dining solo, you'd pay double the listed price. We opted for the a la carte menu because we wanted to try specific dishes.\n\nOne thing that truly sets Uovo apart is their pasta. They don't extrude it in-house; it's shipped overnight, ensuring peak freshness. We tried two pasta dishes, and let me tell you, they were phenomenal!\n\nThe first pasta we tried was Cacio e Pepe. The handmade tonnarelli (a thicker, more substantial cousin of spaghetti) had a satisfying bite that cradled the sauce beautifully. The Pecorino Romano DOP ensured a rich, salty depth that perfectly complemented the peppery kick. Imagine creamy, nutty cheese clinging to the pasta, punctuated by bursts of black pepper flavor.\n\nThe second pasta we tried was Ragu. It stayed true to its Bolognese roots by featuring a rich blend of beef and pork without any cheese, milk, or cream.\n\nBoth the pastas were delicious, but the portion was smaller, which had us craving for more.\n\nWe also indulged in the Yellowtail Crudo appetizer. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the combination of chili pepper, micro-arugula, and citrusy dressing created a delightful burst of flavor.\n\nBut save room for dessert! The Tiramisu was, hands down, one of the best I've ever had in the States. It struck the perfect balance of richness, creaminess, and coffee flavor.\n\nOverall, Uovo is a fantastic dining experience. While the wait and slightly cramped space might be a consideration, the incredible pasta, fresh ingredients, and delightful desserts make it absolutely worth it."

We chose outdoors to take in the sun & beach vibes. Service was slow at 6pm on Sunday.\nOur server Joe was professional and to the point. He resembled actor Liam Neeson a bit :|)",
      "The dining experience was wonderful. All of the staff went out of their way to make us feel special. We don\u2019t  order a lot and don\u2019t drink which leads some places to treat us a bit poorly. Not here. We were treated like  we ordered the most expensive champagne and steak dinner. We came in late and really enjoyed our light but very filling meal.  I had the famous table side Cesear and crab cake.  My husband had the waguy meatball and the wedge salad. He loved them both. I loved the salad. It was very good. The crab cake had just enough breading and the crab was very fresh. .",
      "I visited this restaurant on a Monday evening during their ONE-hour Happy Hour. Upon arrival, I was initially asked if I was there to pick up a delivery order, possibly due to my casual dress. After clarifying, I chose to sit at the bar. The bartender, a man named Ryan (if I recall correctly), was friendly and professional. He didn't make any assumptions and engaged me in a brief conversation before taking my drink order.\n\nFor starters, I chose the boneless sweet chili pepper wings from the limited Happy Hour menu. They were absolutely delicious\u2014perfectly fried, tender, and well-seasoned. Next, I ordered the shrimp scampi, which was not part of the Happy Hour menu but was worth every penny. The dish featured three jumbo shrimp in a delightful lemony sauce with capers and onions, accompanied by a small piece of bread. It was heavenly to say the least!\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I decided on the steak frites with fries. Given that this is a steakhouse, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed when my steak arrived. It wasn't the teriyaki-like sauce that made it appear dark\u2014it was the fact that the steak was burnt, despite my request for a medium-well piece. When Ryan checked in on me, I expressed my dissatisfaction but declined a replacement steak as I needed to return to my room promptly.\n\nI ate what I could, had a few more drinks, and requested the check. To my surprise, the total was just over $150, with the burnt steak still included in the bill. While I didn't expect a complete comp, a gesture acknowledging the charred steak would have been appreciated. Despite this, I will return for the restaurant's chill but elegant ambiance, the excellent bartender, and those delicious boneless wings. However, I think I'll stick to having steak elsewhere.",
      "Probably one of the best burgers ( bar menu ) I\u2019ve ever had. The lychee margarita was delectable! Service was attentive and personable but not overbearing ( which we appreciate). Will 100% be back to dine again.",
      "Appetizers and sides were good (minus the brussels sprouts) but we were very disappointed in the main dishes. My partner had the lamb chops and I had the roasted chicken. The lamb chops were a bit chewy and lacked flavor without the sauce. The chicken was completely flavorless. Even the asparagus and potatoes lacked flavor.\n\nWe chose this restaurant because we were celebrating my partner\u2019s bday. There were quite a few parties that were celebrating a special occasion around us. I noticed that each party received cake and ice cream so I requested it as well. I put in the request with our first waitress which was communicated to the waiter that took her spot but for some reason he brought out two cookies and a small scoop of ice cream which had hair in it. It\u2019s safe to say we probably won\u2019t go back."

I do love the history. The fish in the wall apparently was caught by General Patton off Catalina Island prior to World War 2. I really enjoyed my time here.

      "I love it here. The food and vibes are always great. I did have a reservation at 7 and was not seated till a little after 730 due to overbooking and how crowded it was. Had a few martinis while waiting so I was pretty drunk for dinner which made the food taste even better. I love their scampi and potatoes. Love it",
      "Very great seafood. The sand dab was wonderful. The free bread was served warm and smothered in garlic flavored butter. The potato side was wonderful. Great service. Only complaint was that my table was in the middle and bar guests kept talking or moving over me or running into my chair. Also,  it was a bit too dark inside."

      "Went there with my best friend for her birthday \ud83c\udf82 It was amazing! The waiter Matthew was very knowledgeable in cocktails and super welcoming. We ordered the combo platter and chicken pasta- such a big portion! The combo platter had many different kinds of veggies and seafood. The chicken pasta was creamy and juicy. Chocolate flourless cake was our dessert - super rich! Drinks were affordable and nice. The bread was the only thing that I wouldn\u2019t recommend\u2026 a bit dry \u2026 Would definitely come back again.\ud83e\udd29",
      "Well.... It could've been better. Food was okay. They brought us cold bread and cold butter \ud83e\udd22, they forgot my appetizer and didn't even apologize for it not coming. They interrupted our way by asking us to move for a party of twenty and promised a dessert \ud83c\udf82, which is exactly what they gave a party of 3, ONE, dessert. Creme Brulee was ice cold \ud83e\udd76. Never expected that. Unfortunately, I Probably will not return.",
      "Good food. Borderline of wow quality. But the dish my SO got wasn't impressive. We both did build your own pasta, but we'll try ones from the menu next time.\nAdequate service.\n\nI'd definitely back when I'm around, but I cannot travel more than 20 minutes for this restaurant,",
      "I visited this beautiful restaurant yesterday with friends after the Getty Center trip.\n\nI ordered lobster and shrimp ravioli and jumble ravioli, black and white spaghetti, and Misto salad. The salad is fresh and healthy, with fresh veggies on walnuts and pine nuts. The black-and-white spaghetti tastes out of the world! The Ravioli are good too.\n\nThe Challenging part is parking. It's really hard to park on the street. I tried for a while then went to the restaurant to ask their employee, one gentleman told me to go across the street and park at the Santa Monica Public Library, you can pay 3 dollars to park there.\n\nI'm going to take my family next week to the Getty center and then visit this place again. I",
      "Great experience & food! Upon walking in, we were greeted immediately by 2 busy waiters. Staff was incredibly friendly & helpful.\nGluten goat cheese pasta was fabulous and super tasty, added chicken.\nAlso had chicken alfredo & ricotta pillows as an appetizer. We were given a gluten-free chocolate cake that was delish! We'll be returning."

      "Love to come here for their pasta and pizza but the couscous was always calling my name. I come from Brussels and I was afraid to be disappointed. But that\u2019s no way to live a life, so I went this time and tried it !\n\nIt is delicious, will probably come back every time I crave a couscous!\nIt\u2019s probably my new favorite spot in town!\n\nPlus, a word for the amazing staff that made the birthday all the party girl\u2019s wishes come true! Great team!",
      "Massilia is a nice restaurant in downtown Santa Monica. We came for a weekend brunch but it wasn\u2019t too busy and we got a nice spot outside, but far from the street so it was calm. We ate from the Dine LA lunch menu and were very impressed. Cafe drinks and appetizers were standard and had no issues. The bouillabaisse was very uniquely flavored and memorable, and the mushroom pizza was enormous and satisfying. For dessert we had tarte tatin, which was sizable and tasty. I think the food could be more refined, but given the low price we paid for the tasting menu, it certainly met my expectations and I left full, with a few leftover slices of pizza for dinner!",
      "Everyone needs to go try their 8-hour lamb shank, I\u2019m still thinking about it from last night. We did the Dine LA menu and the portions were so big! The staff was more than friendly and we had a great time. We enjoyed everything and will be coming back",
      "This review is for the Happy Hour! Tapas, small shared bites for food under $10. There is a set cocktail menu for Happy Hour. Prices are 50% off, however if you ask to switch it up, like change a Gin to Vodka, then the price goes back to regular price.\n\nMindy, our bartender was fabulous and informative!\n\nI will definitely return again! Nice ambience!",
      "Came here with my girlfriend for lunch. The setting and ambience is a vibe. Great date spot. They have couches for seating and they are incredibly comfortable. The food was 3.9 stars, but the space is 5 stars. We got the Pasta Bolognese and Spicy Chicken Wings. I was happy enough with both dishes and the price was fair for the quality. Both left something to be desired in terms of flavor, texture, and presentation. I would gladly come back here but wouldn\u2019t get the same meals. It\u2019s worth a visit if you want a beautiful and cozy space to enjoy a meal in.\n\nP.S. The otherwise beautiful chandelier needs some TLC. There is so much dust on it that it looks fluffy."

      "I have nothing to complain about in this restaurant. I have never encountered such an atmosphere before. I\u2019ll keep the words of delight to myself, just watch the video... Delicious and light food. I will definitely visit this place again.",
      "We went to Jonah\u2019s Kitchen for our anniversary with a large group. The back patio is so charming and relaxing. The food is superb. As others have mentioned the brisket is fantastic and the peach cobbler lives up to the hype. Would definitely go back.",
      "Food was RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. So flavorful and rich and comfy. Really hype energy and the staff seemed to have a great vibe with each other. Kelsey helped us out and was SO sincerely kind and accommodating. Go here! (I would all the time if I lived here)",
      "Most definetly an amazing experience. We were told its typically a self serve at counter and pay but since we were a party of 5 she hooked us up with an incredible service. Theyre in process or transitioning to servers. Food was on point, drinks were delish i had mezcal paloma i felt adventurous and shoulda had a normal because it does not mix i shoulda known better but still good same with old fashioned little too sweet for me so maybe next time none for me. The meats were on point perfectly pink and cooked throughout the ribs as well. All of us shared it all. Started with guac and chips, mushroom caps that were to die for omfg, and the meat board i forgot the name but well worth it all of us full with leftover box even. Eventful dinner for my cousins bday celebration with friends!!",
      "Brisket melted in your mouth, and the lamb chops were the best we\u2019ve ever had. We would definitely recommend these!! Price point was great for the quality of the meat. They don\u2019t come with sides, but we split the two meals and with dessert we were full. Order the peach cobbler!! So good!\n\nLost a star because we were ignored for almost 15 mins before a server even came to give us water. Then, when we were ready to leave and asked for the check, another 10 mins until I just went up to the counter and asked to pay. I worked in a restaurant before, I get it. We didn\u2019t order drinks, so that is why we were the least important table in the server\u2019s eye."

The dishes taste great, and it shows that they have put lots of thought and effort to creat healthy and sustainable food that tastes good.\nThe place is super spacious and the staffs are nice.\nIt is kid friendly place. They have kids menu as well.",
      "Outstanding place all around! My wife and I Ubered there - they had all gluten free options for her which she thoroughly enjoyed. I ordered the OG drink - very nice. And the bison sausage pizza = really good especially with the salsa! To cap it off, we ordered the all gluten and dairy free dessert = chocolate chip cookie, coconut ice cream, whipped cream - and the waiter threw it in for free! Thanks bro! Definitely would visit and eat there again!",
      "I will forever dream of the tuna lettuce wraps. they were so good and flavorful with the perfect amount of spice! my steak was pretty much unseasoned so I asked for salt. the vegetables were good along with the vinaigrette. my mom's burrito bowl was delicious! We got dessert but I didn't really care for the blueberry crumble. My drink was the pomegranate seltzer! It wasn't very sweet but was good nonetheless.",
      "Was tasty, if you are European you can feel there safe with food ;) I mean you'll like the dishes. They're nicely presented and healthy! without a ton of fat.",
      "This has to be the best eatery, definitely the best food I had on 4 continents. Fabulous!! When we come back to LA I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ll visit again.\n\nDefinitely worth checking if you want a proper coffee by non-US standards - this is the place. Superb cold brewed coffee. \u2615\ufe0f"

      "It is a phenomenal experience with a wonderful waitress, Ms. CJ. The atmosphere was tranquil, and the cuisines were top notch. I appreciate the prompt services, and it was too difficult to leave such a beautiful restaurant. Hope you enjoy as much as my family did!",
      "I highly recommend the Lobster Mac and Cheese dish! They put plenty of lobster in this dish, and it was delicious! Service was amazing as well.\n\nIt was our first time at this restaurant, and the server was very patience with us (explained what dishes were the most popular). We ordered some lobster as well, and it was also delicious (sweet and fresh).\n\nNot to mention, the view from this restaurant is also breath-taking! Unfortunately, I do not have a photo of the view, but you should see it for yourself!",
      "What an amazing first meal in Santa Monica! Service was fast and efficient. The black linguine is every seafood enthusiasts dream. The crab cakes are delicious and the grits are divine. What an amazing view too, cannot wait to go back.",
      "Delicious seafood with a beautiful view of the Santa Monica Pier. Loved the staff and the atmosphere. The food was very delicious. I would recommend the grilled lobster. It's great for a fancy night out on the town. We had a wonderful evening."

      "If you're looking for a burger fix you need to check out Heavy Handed.\n\nThe menu has a bunch of great options, but would recommend the double combo. The double burger is packed with juicy, flavorful patties that hit the spot every time. The single is good, but the double is the perfect balance of meat, cheese, and all the fixings.\n\nThe vibe here is super chill, too. Whether you're grabbing a quick bite or hanging out with friends, the casual atmosphere makes it a great spot to relax and enjoy some killer food. The staff is always friendly and quick to help out.\n\nSo, next time you're in the mood for a burger in Santa Monica, would recommend Heavy Handed and go for the double.",
      "If you like smash burgers this is the place for you. Long lines, lack of parking and sitting can be a distraction. BUT you can order from their website and simply pick up at the window in less than 5 min....completely bypassing the line!!! We parked, ordered, walked over and found a place to sit and order was ready. My husband loved it. I thought it was adequate but not worth the bother. Cool place to try out if you are in the area.",
      "Cool spot on Main St. First bite of the burger was amazing, but thereafter, you really start to feel the grease sit heavy on your stomach and the taste/flavor is very one note. Love burgers, but hit a wall on this one and couldn't finish it. I get it; it's called Heavy Handed for a reason, so maybe this is not the right place for me. I prefer a few other burger places in SM over this, but it's worth a try and the vibe was definitely lively (for better or worse) on the Friday evening we went.",
      "Went here over the weekend as I was looking for a great burger and Heavy Handed did not disappoint. Best smash burger I\u2019ve had to date.\n\nCool little spot. Had a line up which took 10-15 minutes, but was worth the wait.",
      "Finally crossed this place off of my list of places to try. Verdict? It's good, tasty... but a bit overpriced for what you get.\n\nIt's a smash burger. I got a double for $11 which is pretty steep IMO compared to other places to get a casual burger in LA (In-N-Out, The Win~Dow). The bun was nice and soft. The meat was good quality, had a nice taste, tender, and was smothered with gooey melted American cheese. The heavy sauce in the burger is almost like cane sauce or animal sauce. It's tasty and blends well with the cheese and makes for a rich burger. The onions and especially pickles help cut through the grease and rich/creaminess. The burger size was a bit small for a double patty and after finishing it I was still hungry. I am a pretty big eater though.\n\nThe basket of fries were good and you get a lot with a basket order.\n\nService is basically you order at a window, sit down outside, and try to find a table. It's a vibe outside and it does get busy. They'll buzz your pager when it's ready. Outdoor ketchup dispenser and soda fountain. This food will make you thirsty for sure.\n\nWould I go back? Maybe... but it's not a must. I would try their soft dipped cone and some beers they have next. The food is good, but expensive and I still was hungry afterwards. In all, it's good but I would probably go somewhere else for a burger!"

      "Had a delicious meal with friends here. The host was very kind and worked in our party of 5 on a short notice during a busy weekend night. We shared a lot of dishes, each as wonderful as the next. Chef\u2019s Choice raw oysters were super fresh and juicy, the grilled oysters were fantastic - though I do wish they served crackers or bread with both. (I\u2019m from the Gulf Coast and we love our oysters with a little crispy cracker or saltine - though I realize this is a preference.) The raw scallops with uni were extremely tasty, as well as the shrimp cocktail. Fish and chips were fresh and crispy with just the right amount and texture of breading that didn\u2019t fall off. The side of Mac and cheese was creamy and wonderful, but did need some seasoning.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful meal shared among friends in a quaint outdoor atmosphere. Would absolutely recommend to anyone and will visit again when in the area!",
      "All the seafood is super fresh and delicious.\nThe mussels are by far the best mussels that I have ever had because they are cooked perfectly and the broth isn\u2019t just a regular buttery garlic sauce. It\u2019s super flavorful. The rest of the food is just outstanding.\nThey gave me a key lime pie for my \u201cearly\u201d birthday. My mom is leaving the USA after visiting me here. It\u2019s probably the first time in 25 years that I could celebrate my birthday with her even though it\u2019s an early birthday. I really appreciate the dessert. Thank you so much!!!!",
      "Tried the dine LA menu, and loved it! Service was super fast and all the food tasted great. The first course was clam chowder which was light but packed with flavor and really celebrated the flavor of clams. The lobster roll is enormous and comes with a heap of fries. I had the hand roll combo which is great for anyone looking for a flavorful meal without huge portions. Overall I was very impressed and would like to return and try the regular menu.",
      "Terrible service. Uni hand roll had cold rice and tiny. Fish and chips were flavorless. Food did not come out at the same time. Oysters were redeemable, but definitely not worth the price.",
      "This joint is in a great location, can't imagine what they must pay for rent.  That would at least explain the need to charge $18 for the grilled artichoke- which, don't get me wrong, it's excellent.  The cocktail shrimp and oysters are also delicious.  Order any of the chilled seafood dishes and you won't regret it."

Highly recommend!",

      "Absolutely amazing service and amazing food! Our cocktails were made perfectly, and they definitely had a nice kick. Nothing makes me more upset than when they charge you a ton of money and measure out your booze, this is not that place! The restaurant has cool vibes and a unique modern / classic decor. If you're looking for a smaller non-chain steakhouse that does things right this is the place for you!\n\nSpecial shout out to Patrick the sommelier! Talk about a guy that's good at his job, knows the wines, and doesn't miss a beat... this is the guy. To top that off he has a great personality and made our evening all that much more special! Thank you Patrick and team Fia, you guys are doing a great job. Keep up the good work!!!",

The service was really friendly.\nWe didn\u2019t really touch the pastry basket but the coffee cake was good. We ordered the shrimp and grits and the eggs benedict.

      "Easily one of the best breakfasts that I have had in Santa Monica. I have pretty much been everywhere so that\u2019s really saying something. There\u2019s a lot about this place that I really like. First the food quality is great. Our server was extremely polite and very attentive. They have a free giant parking lot in the back, and plenty of seating inside. We sat at the bar because all the dining tables were taken, but it was still a really nice experience. They don\u2019t have a very large menu, but they do have a lot of great choices on it. Lunetta At Night shares the same roof, but is next-door. I plan to be back in the near future to try it because their breakfast was that good.\n\nI started off with a Cappuccino, and it was terrific. Strong and flavorful just like I like it. I chose the Eggs Benedict for my entr\u00e9e and honestly really loved it. I got a side of the chipotle a\u00efoli, and it was a great combination with the mini potatoes. I especially liked how the ham is shaved instead of a thicker Virginia type ham. I thought it was great and I would order it again.\n\nOverall a great breakfast option in Santa Monica with extremely easy parking. I would recommend to anyone and I plan to be back in the near future.",
      "I recently had the pleasure of dining at this charming restaurant with a large group for my baby shower with friends and I must say, it was an overall wonderful experience. From the moment we walked in, the ambiance and decor created a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe service was prompt and friendly, and our server was knowledgeable about the menu, guiding us through the various options. As a large group, it can sometimes be challenging to accommodate everyone's dietary preferences and restrictions, but this restaurant offered a wide array of dishes that catered to all tastes. The menu featured a delightful blend of traditional and innovative cuisine, showcasing the chef's creativity and expertise.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food; it was absolutely outstanding! Each dish we ordered was beautifully presented, and the flavors were simply exquisite. The attention to detail in each plate was evident, and it was evident that the chef had put a lot of thought and care into every ingredient and combination. From the perfectly seared scallops to the succulent braised short ribs, every bite was a burst of flavor.\n\nThe portion sizes were generous, ensuring that everyone left satisfied. Additionally, the restaurant was accommodating when it came to special requests and substitutions, making the dining experience tailored to our preferences.\n\nWhat truly stood out during our meal was the way the restaurant staff handled our large group. Despite the hustle and bustle, they managed to remain attentive, ensuring that we had everything we needed and that our glasses were never empty. They were patient with our questions and requests, making us feel valued and appreciated as guests.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience. The food is top-notch, the ambiance is inviting, and the service is exceptional. Whether you're dining with a large group or on a fun brunch date, this restaurant is sure to impress.",
      "Went for brunch. Nice atmosphere - light and bright. Tried lemon ricotta pancakes which were fine but nothing to write home About.\nThey were sticky in your mouth and not enough syrup was given on the plate and the butter is melted butter. The fried chicken was dry - that was disappointing.\nThe mimosas for the table came pre-mixed in a carafe and didn\u2019t taste like there was much champagne in it. Too much OJ. I would ask for it separately and make your own. The mushroom/ cheese omelette was good The waitress/server was excellent.\nThe booth we were given is for tall people and we had to sit on the edge of it most of the time as sitting against the back was awkward. Pillows for the back would have helped. Nice place but likely won\u2019t go back.",
      "Perfect food, we loved everything, Crisp Chicken & Pancake, Avocado Toast, fresh orange and lemon juice, fresh brewed coffee and Cappuccino. The service was great and everyone is smiling, the place is beautiful and perfect for breakfast, bathroom is ok, and enjoyed our meal. Kids and adults loved it \u2764\ufe0f"

      "The truffle tortellini is excellent - tons of flavorful cheese and truffle flavor.\nThe branzino was excellent - crispy and well-seasoned. I didn't like the vegetables on it, though, and the green sauce it comes with doesn't really go well with it, but it had all the lemon juice in the green sauce.\nThe wild boar pappardelle was delicious. The boar had a gamey taste with a texture similar to beef. The sauce and pasta was perfect.\n\nWaitress was very friendly and helpful with suggestions.\nThe interior is very nice and elegant -- a perfect date spot.\nThe price for portions are also very reasonable.\n\nFinding parking can be kind of annoying.",
      "We came here because our son loves Italian cheeses. We started with three types of cheese as appetizers. The restaurant serves the cheeses with orange marmalade m, crackers and nuts. The cheeses were excellent and each small serving costs $6-7. Then we tried the wild boar pasta and truffle risotto. Both were good, but not great. The desert of semifreddo, which was a serving of half frozen gelato and other treats it was delicious and highly recommended. There are some street parkings available, but we were there quite early at 5 pm.",
      "Nice restaurant that\u2019s easily accessible with good ambiance. I ordered the charcuterie board,  bruschetta, and opted to  add two different cheeses options; a semi-hard cheese and a hard cheese. For the two cheese additions, it was an additional $15.  The cheese was high quality but the portion was a bit too small, even for a charcuterie board. The bruschetta was served in a bowl with bread crumbs which was very unique and tasty.\nMy husband ordered the chicken and mushrooms which was cooked in a white wine reduction sauce which he said was very good. He also ordered the grilled Spanish octopus which he said was seasoned well but the octopus was slightly overcooked.\nMy son ordered the lasagna which was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. For desert we ordered a scoop of chocolate gelato and Nutella bread pudding. The gelato was standard but good. The bread pudding was still a little too wet in my opinion and needed a couple more minutes in the oven but that may just be a personal preference as I\u2019m not one to eat bread pudding frequently. Also I don\u2019t think it was made with Nutella in the mix, just drizzled on top after it came out of the oven.\nI\u2019d may go back again if given the opportunity but there was honestly nothing there that left me craving more.",
      "Excellent cheese selection. And I really mean it!!! If you're looking for a glass of wine and a cheese platter, this is the place.\nPasta is okay. Nothing near to al dente. Risotto reminds me of rice porridge. Service wants to be enhanced too.",
      "Thought the food was pretty good. Service was a little confused and it took like an hour for each course, which is not bad, just unexpected. Liked my lasagna and chopped salad. The tiramisu was awesome. Nice little spot on Montana."

      "All time favorite when in Santa Monica.  Service is outstanding. Ivy was friendly and efficient.  Food is always exceptional. Love the beet salad, chopped salad, curry chicken and calamari for lunch.  Outside seating is comfy and quiet",
      "Always consistent and a lovely spot to sit outside on a nice Sunday morning for breakfast.   The johnny cakes are wonderful as are the coffees and egg dishes.   The kids menu is great and the service terrific!",
      "We came here for dinner. Most of the seating is outside, but we sat inside, which was perfect for us. I ordered the Steak Salad ( $22) which came beautifully presented, but the dressing drenched the salad. The steak was perfectly cooked. I ate all the steak! Next time, I will ask for the dressing on the side. My friend ordered the Turkey Burger ( $20) which was tasty, sloppy and a bit on the smoky flavor. She said she would not order it again. The curly fries were very tasty!\n\nWe finished with a Lava Cake, beautifully presented, but it was the smallest scoop of ice cream on this planet! Very rich in flavor. Will I order it again, probably not.\n\nI will try Art's Table again perhaps for breakfast or lunch, but not for dinner.",
      "The food was nice. One dish was Grandma's hash. It was a little bit over spicy. It came with a scrambled egg on top. I feel the dish would of been better with an over easy egg. To break an egg yolk into that hash would of been special! The second dish was a wonderful Turkey burger. The restaurant has a nice neighborhood feel to it. The Staff.... well the staff are not professional. When you pay top dollar you expect Pro Waiters. Don't get me wrong the staff is nice but nice is nice. And nice, does not make the food taste better.",
      "Charming outdoors dining scene.  Very mediocre food\u2014wouldn\u2019t recommend anything we had.  Salads would probably be safest."

The Fecacia bread was AMAZING! Even with it being close to the pier, this place seems like a hidden gem, well worth it! The only \"negative\" would be that it seemed like 1 server was on duty and he was SUPER BUSY the entire time.",
      "Nestled right by Santa Monica Pier, this is a decent restaurant I found while looking for a place with an outdoor seating. Not many items on the menu, and the burger was okay. I loved their fries though. Staff were super  friendly and extremely attentive, while the ambiance was terrific. They have a pretty sweet outdoor patio, and the inside gives you that fun, beach vibe suited for Santa Monica. Ideal for a casual Friday date!",
      "We had an incredible experience at this restaurant. Sitting outside on the comfy couch with tables was a delight, especially with the cozy throw pillows and blankets that kept us warm against the ocean breeze. The ambiance and decor were outstanding, creating a perfect vibe. From our seats, we enjoyed a view of the pier entrance and some excellent people-watching.\n\nThe food was spectacular. We ordered the mahi-mahi fish tacos and the fried chicken sandwich, both of which were absolutely delicious. The tacos featured fresh, homemade tortillas and a perfectly balanced mix of ingredients, complemented by a lime half dipped in Tajin for an extra kick. The fried chicken sandwich was packed with flavor, with epic toppings and a buttery bun that didn\u2019t get soggy. This place truly knows how to cook!\n\nFor drinks, he enjoyed a refreshing IPA while I sipped on unsweetened iced tea with lemon. Both beverages were perfect for a beach day and paired wonderfully with our meals.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for an upscale venue in a touristy area. The prices were average for LA but well worth the money. After our delicious lunch, we walked right over to the beach and pier. There are plenty of paid parking options within a block. We chose the multi-story parking structure nearby, paying about $8 for 5 hours, which covered our lunch and beach time.\n\nYou won\u2019t be disappointed here!",
      "Great food - last phenomenal restaurant before you get to Santa Monica Pier - located within the Pierside Hotel. - the surfing Fox offers a wonderfully unique and delicious menu - I ate here a half dozen times during my recent stay - and my favorite was salmon eggs Benny, I also loved the breakfast sandwich and the breakfast burrito- the coffee is La Columbe and is truly delicious- I recommend this place - but the brunch is divine!!!",
      "Amazing beach vibe local grub spot served up with a snarky attitude. Gotta love it. Surf stand Food beach vibe just off Santa Monica Harbor. Highly recommend."

      "The lunch meal we ordered was above average; I enjoyed the fish and chips and the tartar sauce was excellent, as was our server Gabriel. Touristy and pricey, but consider the location. Overall, good eats.",
      "My friend and I checked out the Santa Monica Pier one Saturday and decided to try this place (since we saw the mediocre reviews for Bubba Gump\u2026). We were very happy with our decision.\n\nWe arrived around 11:30 and were able to pick where we sat. We sat outside on the upper floor balcony with stunning views of the pier and beach below. Our server was quick and attentive, but not too attentive. We never had our waters refilled. I was surprised the prices weren\u2019t astronomical, as we were right on the pier, but I feel like in this day and age, you get what you pay for.\n\nI ordered the fish and chips and my friend got the impossible vegan burger. Our food came out rather quickly and the fries were excellent - seasoned nicely and tasted fresh. My friend enjoyed her burger and I really liked my cod \u201cnuggets.\u201d The only downside was that I wish there was one more fish piece; they were delicious after all. I also liked the coleslaw, just wish there was a little more of it.",
      "We decided to dine here because of its location on the pier, offering indoor seating, outdoor patio seating, and rooftop seating. The restaurant is situated right in front of the ocean, although the view is only accessible from the outdoor areas.\n\nUpon arrival, a host welcomed us at the door, but after that, service was a bit haphazard. They had a wide selection of alcoholic drinks and were able to make a mocktail margarita for a child, which was much appreciated by both of us. It was exceptionally tasty.\n\nWe started with a shrimp cocktail served in a traditional glass. However, it was more watery and sugary than expected, tasting more like ketchup than the usual ingredients. We sent the untouched shrimp cocktail back and moved on to our main courses.\n\nFor our entr\u00e9es, I had a ribeye served with what seemed to be canned or frozen thin green beans and fries, while the child had a cheeseburger and fries. I have to give credit where it's due: the ribeye was perfectly cooked to medium-well. Despite the typical fattiness of a ribeye, the fatty parts were well-grilled and, with a bit of added salt, quite delicious. The meal was very affordable.\n\nI requested that the shrimp cocktail be removed from the bill since we had sent it back almost immediately. The staff graciously complied without any fuss. The restaurant is kid-friendly with a casual dress code and multiple seating options. When we walked by on the weekend, there seemed to be live music or perhaps music from a nearby restaurant, but either way, it looked like a good time.",
      "We had a wonderful service. The food was amazing. The southwest burger was very filling and the meat was cooked just right. The shrimp sandwhich was delicious. Reasonable portions. Views are phenomenal",
      "The service was great! Our waitress was very polite and welcoming! The food was also great. I got a big bacon burger, and it was delicious besides falling apart a little bit. The bathrooms, however, were a little gross, and the way around was a little confusing. Other than that, we got the second floor with an amazing view and had a great time!"

      "R+D is consistently good. They have it down to a science. Some quirks that enable them to be so consistent are limited ability for substitutions and that their takeout menu is limited to certain items to preserve quality (eg items that don\u2019t hold up well when consumed 20+ minutes later in a takeout container aren\u2019t available). There is also often a wait but that\u2019s a virtue of its popularity. None of that is a complaint just helping set expectations for people. Other than that food is always fantastic, service also great and wine/beer/cocktails stellar as well.",
      "This place runs a tight ship. If you make a reservation, make sure you have your whole party there at the time of the reso. They have great food and service, and to have that you need a tight ship so kudos to the team there. Open kitchen concept is very nice with some friendly chefs. The little bird (and creamy polenta\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8) were amazing and the banana cream pie was quite literally the icing on top. The Pupp approves.",
      "Everything was top tier from the food, to service, presentation, and cleanliness. However the bathroom situation there is a little less than ideal and awkward. The stalls are single room closed door but the sinks are outside the bathroom in the same small area you're waiting to use the restroom.. during a busy time there would be a major traffic jam and messy with water dripping on the floor making the restaurant itself liable. It would also be nice if they had a patio but they are able to keep the door open so if you're close to the front you get a nice semi outdoor experience. The tables on the sidewalk IMO does not count for a patio and didn't seem comfortable. Being in southern California near the beach I expected a full maintained patio option. Otherwise it's a great place if you have a small group or dining solo. Wouldn't recommend for family or large groups.",
      "Loved the vibe. Excellent cocktails. Super friendly waiter. It is strange to find a spot in LA these days that excels on all fronts. As other reviewers have pointed out, the chicken sandwich and tuna burgers are must trys. The jackrabbit and negroni were both excellent, and the carrot cake was a 10/10. Am pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy I stumbled across R+D"

The main 'problem' you might face is which meal to pick that particular evening, as all are absolutely delicious, or perhaps you feel just somewhat cowardly and going to stick to the proven, over the years, favorites... that's a great dilemma to have and I warmly recommend putting oneself in that position, if not already done so...\nbuon appetito!",
      "Magnificent!!!\n\nMy daughter and I were visiting the area and previewed the menu- we didn\u2019t have high expectations because so many restaurants boast \u201cauthentic Italian cuisine.\u201d\n\nThe food we consumed reminded me of Italy!\n\nFolks- you will not be sorry.\n\nThe portions are handsome.

While there are space heaters- it gets chilly because you\u2019re by the sea, so I do recommend something warm for the latter part of the day/evening.\n\nBuon appetito!",

      "Great spot to watch sports.  Plenty of screens. Surprisingly great food.  Garlic wings hit the spot.  Loved the falafel and avocado salad.  Cold draft beers ideal for watching game. Crowd was cheering and into the action.",
      "Stopped for brunch on a Sunday. We had hoped to eat next door but it was too busy and we were on a time crunch. Oddly, The Whaler was almost dead - which gave us pause as to why - but we tried it anyway.\n\nService was quick and the food was unexpectedly great. Our party of 5 each loved our meals! The chicken and waffles was on-point. I loved that the sweetness was baked into the waffle and didn\u2019t require syrup, instead using a creamy hollandaise as the sauce.  The Nutella French toast was universally loved, and the sweet cream served separately in a bowl to dip instead of just melting into milk on top was thoughtful. The ceviche was delicious and fresh and not too spicy. The Captains Breakfast was plentiful and well-prepared and the one that ordered it said it might have been the best waffle he\u2019s ever eaten. He loved that it was crispy on the outside and soft inside. All in an all, we were VERY pleasantly surprised by the food.\n\nThe downside was the cleanliness of the restrooms. Seeing the dingy white doors and hallway leading from the dining room to the restroom was VERY off-putting, and made us concerned about what the kitchen might look like. This is an easy fix that could be cleaned in less than an hour but hasn\u2019t been touched in months, if not years.  The men\u2019s restroom was horrible. Like, truckstop worthy. Super gross. Please, please fix this.  The food and service were great but had I gone to the restroom before ordering, I\u2019d have honestly just walked out and never returned.  If the public-facing side of a restaurant looks like that (especially one in such a prominent tourist spot), it\u2019s not hard to imagine the back of house looks worse.  That\u2019s worrisome.  And an easy fix someone simply refuses to do.  Wiping down the bathroom doors halfway areas should be ongoing side work for a server each night.",
      "Went here and got two mango carts for 26$ with tax and 20% tip it was 34$. Now that I look on my transactions on my bank app I see our server who goes by \u201cGhost B\u201d  charged me an even 50$ flat for two beers. I kept the receipt that says 28.66 and funny enough the receipt does not show the 20% tip so that tells me she manipulated the POS system to tip herself more after I left. We have seen these schemes in TikTok where they tip themselves however much they want. and I did not think she would that to me. It looks like she had a few drinks so maybe she thought she was invincible. I made a claim to my bank and hopefully people stay away or simply pay cash to avoid these unauthorized transactions.",
      "Descent first time experience, service was slightly slow might be short handed i understand, great happy hour Tacos didn\u2019t come with salsa clam chowder was luke warm quesadilla was good, will give them another shot next time we are in the area.",

Not only convenient but excellent food, cocktails and wines.\n\nOne of my favorites is the mussels with sourdough bread. Great for sharing, but you must pay extra for the toasted sourdough bread which you must have to dip into the wonderful seafood broth (perfectly spiced and seasoned.)\n\nThe second is the mushroom truffle pizza. Ghisallo, known for their pizza, is a block or 2 away, but i think Local's pizza is better. Better cheeses, less oily, crispier, thinner crust. The best IMO.\n\nLastly, the 24 oz bone-in aged ribeye. This is a great dish to share. I love the chef's version of this classic dish. Again, other places can serve bone-in ribeye steak, but the smoky, grilled flavor is amazing.  The only negative is that sometimes the ribeye may have a lot of fat. Sometimes, I'm cutting away 20% of the steak. I'll have to search back and find a picture of their ribeye and post it.\n\nOverall, as a local, I enjoy eating here and trying their different dishes. They're all pretty good. Coming out of the pandemic, they had the best outdoor patio seating arrangement: cozy, front patio and a large parking lot patio, all with ample patio heaters. I prefer the indoor seating but it can get really loud when busy.  I also gave only 4-stars for service, because sometimes, they seem understaffed. The service staff are good and friendly, but can be overwhelmed during peak hours. Thus we eat early and leave early, often taking our leftovers and walking back home. It's great to take a nice walk after dinner.",
      "Where do I begin?  Everything was phenomenal.\n\nThe vibe is laid back, but sharp.  Wanna dress up for a date?  Do it.  Wanna wear jeans and a t-shirt to hang out with a friend?  Do it.\n\nThe welcome was genuine and friendly and the menu\u2026 we wanted to order all of it!\n\nSince we aren\u2019t gluttons, we settled on the mushroom toast, fried artichoke hearts and an arugula salad with a truffle mushroom white pizza.\n\nIn a word: delish!\n\nAll of it was expertly prepared and I was darned close to licking the plates.  Now that I think of it, that\u2019s the one thing I regret not doing.\n\nAlso, well over half their wines are available by the glass.  It\u2019s a great selection from California, France, Italy and Spain (and maybe some other places in Europe)\n\nLastly, the olive oil cake was probably the best I\u2019ve ever had.  It wasn\u2019t too sweet and the blueberry compote was a perfect addition.\n\nWe will definitely go back.",
      "I had a 3 hour dinner here with a group of 5. The service, food, and atmosphere were all great. The staff was so friendly and the roof was retractable, giving us direct sunlight and a lot of fresh air. I had the chicken under brick dish which was pretty good.\nWe also shared a cheese board and olive oil cake, both of which were amazing.",
      "Local Kitchen and Wine Bar is under new management and has a new chef. I am happy to report they have really upped their game. The service was great and the food was delicious. We had the mussels, the burrata and the cobbler. We will be back!"

      "Amazing food and service! Thank you to the servers and owner for taking us and seating us 10 minutes before closing. We got late from LAX traffic and were all starving!! We got eggplant parm, pugila pizza, molfetta pizza and Rosa pasta. Everything was delicious. Tons of vegetarian options. Highly recommend this place!!",
      "I am an Italian expat, I\u2019ve been in the U.S. for 6 years now. I never had a better experience at an Italian restaurant than the one I had at LA Puglia tonight. The food is amazing and authentic. Seafood is fresh, flavorful, perfectly prepared, and at a competitive price for LA. Pizza and pasta are great and taste like the ones back home. On top of that, the whole staff is so attentive, without ever feeling too intrusive, and some of the nicest people we\u2019ve met. I am happy to have found a slice of home in my home away from home.",
      "When I first got here I was already impressed by the slick design of the entire space and the bright warm lighting.\nThen the fact that this is a hub for a creative gathering here every Tuesday 10am-12:00 and I got invited to this beautiful place by other music professionals was a heartwarming quality signature which got me curious and enchanted when I got here.\nBut it didn\u2019t stop there. I found out about the huge back space where they host amazing high standard live concerts every Tuesday night and we instantly signed up for it. The enjoyed an absolutely delicious dinner in a charming cordial atmosphere and to top it off I got an sms the next day by the wonderful owner of the space, Valentina, who served us in person that night.\nIt\u2019s my new favorite Italian in town for daytime & night time! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\nMuch love to the entire lovely team,\nCarmen Corinna aka. AM!NA Jaguar",
      "Dinner at La Puglia. I was very excited to try as we truly miss the fare from this amazing Italian destination. Unfortunately we were rather disappointed.\nWe started with their steamed Mussels with Cherry Tomatoes. This was very good and the Casereccio bread was also very good.\nThe Ragu and Lasagna both lacked flavor. The Orecchiette with Mussels was very good, although all of the food it would appear that the chef did not use any salt or pepper in the cooking. Pizza was OK (Margherita Style).\nOnce the food arrived no Parmeseano Reggiano was offered, this is Italian?\nService was lacking all night. Staff was not very attentive, we had pile ups of plates and drink glasses.\nOverall we were disappointed. The food in my opinion did not taste like anything we had ever eaten in Puglia which is one of the best foods in Italy.  Having to add salt, Pepper, having no Parmeseano Reggiano and lack of service all lead to our overall dissatisfaction of La Puglia."

      "This place has been around for a LONG time and it is totally understandable. It is truly delicious and charming. It\u2019s got some old world vibes and a real cozy atmosphere. We sat at the bar (which I highly recommend) and the bar tender/server was awesome. She gave us great recommendations, was super friendly, and even suggested things we didn\u2019t know we could do (like 1/2 portions of two pastas and split everything). In the age of \u2018fine dining\u2019 meaning a tasting menu\u2026go here for culinary delights you get to choose for yourself. Also\u2026no time limits! We were there for 3 hours and it flew by but we never felt rushed.",
      "I would say it\u2019s one of the best Italian restaurants in Santa Monica, but it does have some issues. It\u2019s really small and intimate on the inside, you feel like you are eating in someone\u2019s house. It reminds me of a few restaurants that I ate in when I was in Italy last so it had a very authentic feel to me. I am also half Italian so I feel I know good and bad Italian food. The issue we had is that a lot of the items are overpriced. For example steak tartare is $48 and a simple grilled Branzino is $85. For these prices we all felt the food wasn\u2019t special enough to justify the prices. They don\u2019t have a parking lot but metered street parking is easy to find or your other best option would be their valet for $15. Our server was very polite and all of our items came out very quickly. They were a bit slow on the drink refills, but aside from that everything else was very fast.\n\nI started off with the Filet Mignon Tartare and it was very good, although it didn\u2019t have any spice to it so wish it had some mustard or horseradish to it because it felt a little dry to me. Also expensive for $48 which I don\u2019t understand, but I did enjoy it. For my entree I chose the Bucatini with Lamb Ragu and it was fantastic. The portion was a bit small but it had really great and deep flavors. After I finished with the Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 and it was A+. I truly loved it and would highly recommend ordering it.\n\nOverall a nice dinner in a beautiful location although it is overpriced. I would recommend but the price points are really strange.",
      "The dining experience was exceptional in every aspect. From impeccable service to delectable food in a charming, intimate ambiance, it surpassed expectations. Mirco, our server, was outstanding. It's reassuring to find establishments of this caliber still thriving. I highly recommend it and will certainly return.",
      "My husband and I wandered in off the street, jet lagged and very hungry, after the kitchen had closed. Nether the less, we were seated and served a three course meal that was delicious and we had a special bottle of wine. The staff could not have been more accommodating and gracious especially as we kept them long after other patrons had departed. Capo turned an evening that had started out poorly into a very pleasant and memorable surprise.  Thank you muchly.",
      "This is a tough critique to write because the management staff were very courteous, and worked me in to an otherwise busy Wednesday night. Still, wait for service was long and I was extremely disappointed with the pasta, which was average at best, but came highly recommended. Not only was it, \u201cjust OK\u201d, but it came with an undisclosed price tag of approximately $250. I had read the reviews and was prepared to pay $150 pp. Here\u2019s the thing: they told us their portions were very large [not true] so we decided to split that pasta. For 1 truffle pasta, 2 glasses of wine, and 1 dessert, including tax and tip, our total was $450!\n\nYou can get bigger servings, with more truffle, for half the cost, and still enjoy a legit Italian restaurant experience, at Locanda Positano.\n\nChocolate lava cake, cream & ice cream, was very good. Wine was as well. Good thing or I would have rated two stars."

      "It was more casual than I thought, but overall it's a very good pasta restaurant. You can taste the freshness by their own creation. The lasagna was the highlight. I'd give it a 8 out of 10. It was super thin, which was impressive.\n\nThe Bolognese was good, but not as dynamic as I had hoped. Unfortunately, the focaccia missed the mark altogether. It was completely bread-like and missed the rise, air bubble pockets, and outer crunch, while living in a proper drench of olive oil. So it goes.",
      "Delicious and fresh pasta. The wait could be longer than expected - there should be a better way to reach out to the hostess, which was lacking.\n\nWe tried 3 different pasta and the best one was the lasagna.\n\nWill definitely come back if craving italian food",
      "This place is a must visit if you love pasta. They make all of their pasta by hand and the ingredients are all organic and you can really taste the difference in the food. We arrived for dinner and was quickly seated. The restaurant has a very homey feel with its decor and very inviting ambiance. The staff were all super friendly and helpful. We ordered the Moringa Agnolotti,, Calamarata al Pomodoro,, Focaccia Bread, and a bottle of Valpolicella Ripasso. The pastas were perfectly cooked and bursted with flavor. The bread was fluffy in the middle and crispy on the outside and did a great job of soaking leftover sauce from the pasta. The wine was bold and rich with hints of cherry and nuttiness. We ended with a tiramisu for our dessert which was light and fluffy. Would highly recommend this place",
      "This is hands down the best pasta we have had in Los Angeles. Having traveled Italy extensively and several times, we\u2019ve always craved pasta dishes akin to the quality and distinct flavors you\u2019d find in each town. Colapasta absolutely nails it with a tight menu of dishes that are each a win. The atmosphere is relaxed. The chef is right beside you making fresh pasta. The staff are friendly with great menu recommendations. The prices are affordable. This restaurant is a true gem for anyone craving a great meal. The Casunziei is a must try if you\u2019re a first timer.",
      "What a pleasant place to have lunch. The seating area was relaxing and comfortable. Of course, we came here for its pastas and weren\u2019t disappointed. The serving size was smaller, so we ordered 4 different pastas. The lasagna was as advertised, it was excellent. All other three pastas were very good especially the agnolotti. We\u2019ve never had it before and it was a very pleasant surprise. Highly recommended.  The only downside of our lunch was that it had sold out its bread. Other than that, we enjoyed our experience here very much. And the service was excellent as well."

      "Very British. I introduced my future daughter in law to shepherds pie. She and I both agree the gravy was amazing. She noted the potatoes were delicious and the meat was very rich.

      "We love this place! Whenever we need our London fix we come here and eat the same food we would eat in a pub in London. It\u2019s classic pub food, nothing spectacular nothing disappointing. Service staff are very friendly with good banter, atmosphere is very nice. It\u2019s one of the places you can order a pint of Guinness with black currant and they\u2019ll bring it to you without a \u201cha?\u201d.  Their King size Fish N\u2019 Chips and Poached cod is particularly good. We haven\u2019t tried their Sunday roast or curries, I\u2019ll report back when we do. If you are in Santa Monica and need to get your London fix, give it a good go.\n\nUpdate on 8/27\n\nWe went there for their Sunday roast. They have lamb, beef and veggie patty.   Our friends said the lamb was a little over cooked but the Yorkshire pudding was really nice. Lastly we had their apple pie and it was very good."

Food, ambiance, and service were top notch.\n\nThe restaurant is unique and flooded with wine bottles all over the walls. What a fantastic collection.\n\nHighly recommend the spicy salami pizza and the truffle brie! I would love to come back and experience the rest of the menu",

All the walls look like this.\nVery accommodating staff, our experience was fantastic. Parked in the public parking garage and walked a few hundred feet. Atmosphere, quality of service has us wanting to go back and relive the evening.",
      "Nice restaurant close to Santa Monica pier.\n\nBeautiful interior. Wide selection of wines and champagne. It\u2019s like sitting in a wine cellar. Great atmosphere. Perfect for occasions and celebrations. There\u2019s live performances on Monday night.\n\nFood is decent. Truffle Baked Brie is my favorite. Entrees are mid. You may skip the surf and turf, not the best I\u2019ve had.",
      "I liked this place until yesterday. Sure, dramatically overpriced (I.e their Iberian ham marked up 3-5x from any Spanish specialty market I\u2019ve been to in the states, house cheddar is like 50 bucks for 8oz, etc.), but overall the restaurant has been good and I have enjoyed the product curation. Yesterday I bought some specialty items for a charcuterie board and bought this fancy churned butter for 30+ dollars. I drove home with all of it and was excited to try the butter so I opened it. The sight and smell of it was absolutely horrifying. How could such a nice place let butter of all things sit so long that it rots into a rainbow of putrid mold. I don\u2019t understand it. It would be one thing if this was a grocery store or a small hole in the wall specialty store, but this is Wally\u2019s on Wilshire in the Heart of Santa Monica. With those prices. I brought this monstrosity back into the shop and they barely seemed to react, a muted apology. Then the proceeded to take 15 minutes of my time figuring out how to refund me the item. I\u2019ve spent lots of money there dining and they don\u2019t know who I know - it\u2019s LA after all - and they\u2019re not offering me a store credit, a complimentary product, or so much as a genuine apology for selling me a literal mold culture. Will not be shopping there anytime soon. Extremely disappointed."

Given the heat and the breeze by the beach, outdoor was a lot more cool. Service was\u2026 okay. Food was good for the most part, similar to another post, the lobster was more on the edges of the quesadilla than inside of it. However it was happy hour prices, so maybe that was is it. There was less then 3 other people at the location when we were there.",
      "Fast and friendly service!\n\nSat outside on a beautiful Saturday morning!\n\nOur server suggested the Connecticut roll and it was bomb! 10/10 flavorful, soft buttery bread, good lobster for the value! Highly recommend!\n\nCalamari Fries and cocktail sauce!! Omg! So yummy-meaty and tender and served steaming hot and fresh!",
      "All right here goes. I don't normally hand out 5 stars, but this place is phenomenal. The gentleman behind the counter recommended the Connecticut role as opposed to the Maine role. The Connecticut role is warmer and buttery, whereas the Maine role is cold with an aioli sauce. It was a toss-up because they both sounded blissful. That first bite of The warm, buttery melt-in-your-mouth bun sent me straight to the Pearly Gates.  Unfortunately, there was no one next to me to slap so I slapped myself it was that good. The fries were excellent, too.",

Being from DC, we don't get amazing stuff like that, unless ones preference is IPAs. Got the lobster rolls and lobster grilled cheese. This place is a must and when I come back to the west coast again, I am definitely stopping by for a couple hours.",
      "Loved it, food is so good and service is A1. All food is so delicious and fresh. Lobster \ud83e\udd9e tail is too nice for 15 dollar. Lobster tacos and clam chowder soup was awesome. Ambiance is small but cozy and beautiful. Will love to come back here again"

Escargot was excellent and served with walnuts - something new. Salmon was perfectly prepared as was the bed of asparagus below the fish. The bacon-wrapped scallops were cooked to perfection and sat atop a puree of parsnips with crisped basil and micro greens folded in. All of it delicious.",
      "Aesthetic and service (had Nick as our server) was AMAZING, but food was very mediocre.\n\nGrilled Octopus (with Romesco Sauce, Avocado) -\nReally like the octopus here. It was perfectly cooked and not rubbery or anything like that. That Romesco Sauce on the side paired perfectly with the octopus. Totally recommend this dish!\n\nMediterranean Hummus (with Crudite) -\nHummus was absolutely delicious! Smooth and creamy and actually went really well with so many other items we ordered. It was a good volume of the hummus so there was plenty left over even after the veggies were eaten.\n\nGrilled Asparagus Side -\nThey accidentally brought someone else's order to our table here, but this asp was Lovely! I don't usually like asparagus, but this was an exception. Great with that hummus!\n\nCauliflower Steak - the cauliflower was still hard on the inside and not like a steak; More like a head of roasted cauliflower.\nEnded up eating just a quarter and taking the rest home to cook it more.\nThis was the disappointment I would say.\n\nPoulet Aux Morilles - Chicken entree\nNot a bad dish but nothing fancy about this one. Husband had ordered this and if I'm not mistaken it was a little salty? Or a little dry? I'm not sure which but there was some issue here which made the dish a little lacking in something special.\n\nLamb Chops -\nFriend ordered this and he seemed to really like it. I didn't try but the presentation was beautiful and he finished the entire plate so I take it as a good sign.\n\nEndive Salad -\nAnother one ordered by our friend. Love the amount of vegetables in here but not a fan of how oily it was. I didn't want to try too much of it just because of the oil in there.\n\nWe noticed they had a chocolate fountain while we were leaving and the server. Nick was generous enough to give us some fruit and a bunch of that chocolate on a plate. Really rich chocolate and a good end to the meal.\n\nShout out to the server again for just giving us a fun time with conversation and laughter.",
      "Highly recommend this rooftop restaurant bar in Santa Monica.\n\nThe food is delicious.  My kids and I had the brunch special.  The union soop was really good.  The Cesar salad was also good. Highly recommend to get the calamari. These calamari are above and beyond any calamari you have tasted, my kids approve.  My son also loves the Kobe beef, and I loved the chicken sandwich.\n\nService was okay. The waitress was lacking attention to the table.\n\nThe restaurant has laughing sofas, bamboo and rope decorated  areas and a great covered patio that lets the sun shine in.  It brings a bright and relaxing environment where you can enjoy the food with your friends.",
      "Arrived when they opened for lunch so we could have a quick bite while waiting for our hotel checkin. The pizza rivaled those we had in Italy, the drinks were superb, and the ceviche was also flavorful. Great service and adorable location. Quiet for a weekday lunch which we appreciated.",
      "I thought the food, service, and atmosphere at LouLou\u2019s was very nice.\nPoached salmon with asparagus was delicious.\nTuna tartare on chips was yummy.\nSweet shrimp on a stick was overly sweet for my taste, but still very good and very popular.\nThe restaurant is on the top (3rd) floor of the mall. It can also be a little cold when the weather is cold because of its open walls."

      "Sogno Toscano is a new Italian favorite of mine! Growing up with homemade Italian food, I was always so particular about the Italian restaurants I would go out to. This one tasted so comforting and authentic. I can\u2019t recommend it enough if you are looking for flavors that are true to Italy. It felt like home in a way, and the vibe was so warm and welcoming! I can\u2019t wait to take my husband here because he is obsessed with Italian food! I highly recommend ordering the Vegetarian Lasagna! And for dessert, the Tiramisu!",
      "After visiting Sogno Toscano in New York, I had such a positive experience that I made sure to make a reservation at their LA location. Although I have yet to visit Tuscany myself, they brought the fully immersive Italian dining experience to Santa Monica Beach. We were warmly welcomed and instantly seated in our area of preference and felt so well taken care of the entire night. It's the perfect spot for a morning cappuccino, afternoon spritz, or evening dinner!",
      "Amazing schiacciate and fabulous atmosphere.\n\nThis place came highly recommended for their authentic Tuscan style food, particularly the schiacciate. I am happy to report that it lived up to the expectations.\n\nWent here on a Saturday for lunch. We were seated right away in their beautiful outdoor area. We got 2 different sandwiches and they both were great. The ingredients were fresh, albeit slightly sparse for my taste, and the bread was the star of the show, as expected.\nIt may seem a bit pricey, at about $26 for a single sandwich, but when you factor in the ambiance and the overall level of quality it\u2019s somewhat justified.\n\nThe level of quality is evident in everything. From the food, to the service, to even the customized plates (check the bottom of the plates, lol).\n\nI would recommend this place for special occasions.",
      "A great little hole in the wall wine and food market. The gnocchi was 10/10 as was the Mediterranean salad.\n\nOur server was well informed and cordial. I felt like he knew the menu well and was proud of the restaurant.\n\nThe outdoor patio is a hidden gem",
      "This place is fabulous. Fresh and delicious. Might be the best sandwich I've ever had. Also a great wine list. The fresh pesto pasta was also phenomenal"

      "This was an interesting place to visit right by the corner and near the pier. The atmosphere was great and the dining area was beautiful as well as outside dining. The menu selection was good and the waitress was friendly as the staff. Pricing is what to be expected $$/$, and the food was very good although I noticed the rice portion to be small than the bean portion. Rice was a bit bland but everything else was very good, taco, nachos, quesadillas and the sweet plantains. I noticed that a gentleman had a burrito not sure which one but it was huge and if I ever go back I definitely will choose that humongous burrito. Would recommend. Kids menu as well.",
      "Being from PHX, I have a high standard of what Mexican food should look and taste like. This place being near the pier I expected \u201ctourist\u201d food.\n\nDead wrong- this place is authentic. Best margarita I\u2019ve had this year.\n\nThe food is delicious, and the price is comparable to the area.\n\nDefinitely come here for good food, good atmosphere, and the best margarita in California.",
      "This is my second time at Red O Cantina, and the food did not disappoint. Sadly, the cocktails are a bit lacking hence they are weak, and costly for what you get. Both times I have been here with another couple and they too had the same experience. The atmosphere is great, staff is super friendly and service was wonderful. I would recommend dining here if you are looking for a casual restaurant, a taste of Mexico cuisine, convenient to the pier and plenty of parking.",

Recommend great choices.\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nHappy Hour Food\nWe had a variety of items off the menu. Very delicious and filling.\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nLocation is right across from the pier/beach/street performers.",
      "I'll give the food 5 stars but will say the chips were stale. Julie, our waitress was friendly and provided great service, we ordered jalapeno margaritas with Mezcal amazing, chips (stale) with guacamole and salsa (pace with some spiciness).  My wife and I shared the fajitas, chicken, steak, and shrimp. It was amazing the steak was tender and had good flavor.  We originally came for the butter cake and drinks, butter cake was good.  I recommend this place if you want some good drinks and food. Only took a picture of the butter cake."

      "Been coming here for a few years now, and as a LA / Santa Monica native. It\u2019s one of the best places for brunch and dinner. The food is always consistent, clean, and fresh. What I mean by clean is that it leaves you not feeling all tired and bogged down. Russell, Omar, Chris W. , and Sara has always provided tentative service. The restaurant is very well balanced, the feel, the vibe, the decor. It\u2019s perfect for date night or a casual brunch /dinner. Not to mention their pizzas are top 10 in LA voted by many high level critics. Stop by for pastries and coffee or a full meal.",
      "Excellent food w great service!  We came he for dinner and the manager greeted us w a big smile and a firm handshake since my buddies are regular here.  Order an arugula salad which was light and tasty.  The pizza was a surprise too with an egg in the middle!  Compliments to the chef for an amazingly crisp and light crust.\n\nAnd is that was not enough; the Manager sent us hike with a huge bag of baked goods!! Plan to come back next time I am in LA.",
      "Was so very happy with the food at Milo & Olive! Pastries were fresh, delicious, bursting with flavor. Got the savory farmers makert veggie croissant and sweet cream brioche. The pepperoni & mushroom pizza was good. Liked the crust, but the pizza options are pretty basic and uninspiring.\nThe real star was the Milo Spicy Italian sandwich! Great combo of quality meats and pickled veggies, very balanced flavor, probably the best sandwich I've had in Santa Monica!\n\nExcited to go back and try more of their food! They have generous hours. Opens at 7am for pastries, coffee, bread. Breakfast dishes 8-11am. Lunch and dinner is the same menu 11am-close.",
      "I don\u2019t even know how this place had such great reviews. I had very high hopes for this place, this location was more than an hour away but the food looked, and sounded, great. Which is not the truth. We ordered a couple of dishes. Pizzas, appetizers and sandwiches. So, it\u2019s not as if it was just the one type of food they were lacking in. It all looks better than it tastes.\n\nThe pizzas were soggy and quite rubbery, which is usually not what I\u2019m looking for when I order pizza. Not only that but it was definitely lacking in flavor, as each dish was. If you aren\u2019t going to season your food, at least put salt and pepper on the table.",
      "We came here impromptu with our two year old and it exceeded our expectations. We walked in at 5 and they were able to accommodate us as long as we were done by 7. They had high chair and crayons. Food came out so fast. Loved the mushroom pizza and my daughter loved the kids pizza  - the crust was firm on bottom and very flavorful. The prosciutto app was fresh and worth it. We also had a seasonal peach burrata. All of it was so good we finished with the tiramisu which was very large."

      "We went to this place for a team dinner & it did not disappoint. Food tasted great and was presented well. Service was great, with ambient music. Desserts were good too. Only negative was that they didn\u2019t have non alcoholic drinks on the menu.",
      "Great service and decent food, was dissapointed with 18% surcharge its like paying tip of 40%. Will not dine or recommend anyone to eat here. Also did not say cheese pasta special would be $68. Dissappointed at prices and surcharge that they have here now definitely would not recommend.",
      "We loved Orto so much we visited twice on a 3 night trip to LA!\nThe pasta was absolutely stunning, I had the cheese ravioli and mushroom sauce, it was light but rich and tasty. Up there as the best pasta I have had at an Italian restaurant.\nThe waiting staff are fantastic, chatty, knowledgeable and really helpful, we needed tips for bars and they didn't hesitate to help.\nHighly recommend.",
      "One of the reasons why I don\u2019t like LA\u2026we attempted to walk into two places that were 90% empty, the first one didn\u2019t wanna take us, the second one gave us a table straight in the sun with zero shade, and when we requested one of the other 30 tables that were available, they said they were reserved until we left. Ended up finding this place available on OpenTable and we are so happy that we did. The food is delicious and the service is even better. Highly recommend this restaurant!! The pasta with truffle was delicious, as was the pink sauce. Everything we ordered was very good and the staff and owner are super friendly."

      "Loved being outside at the sugar palm! We sat at the bar and had a happy hour treat. Great cocktails + bites. We were even able to get poolside glasses and take them over to the pool. Loved the blood orange margo and the Moscow mule. Very fresh, and a wonderful staff!",
      "We had the Happy Hour Lamb Leg Berra Tacos, Steamed Mussels and Grilled Asparagus. The Tacos were so good we had to get a second order \ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf2e\nSuch a pretty restaurant located inside the Viceory Hotel. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor area have a fireplace. Happy Hour Daily 3pm-6pm",
      "Was in the LA area for business and decided to go to Santa Monica for a morning walk and breakfast.  Sugar Palm did not disappoint. It is inside a hotel right across from the beach- near the pier.  Service was excellent- very attentive staff and you cannot go wrong with a \u201cDutch Baby\u201d I was pleasantly surprised to see this gem on the menu and it\u2019s a five star for sure.  The outside patio looks very inviting, it was a cool over-cast morning, so we dined inside. Parking on premises is available or grab a spot on the street behind the hotel, if the beach spots are taken.",

      "1st Visit:\nDinner here last on the patio was just lovely in every way.\n\nFirst, the service was impeccable. Our server was patient, friendly, knowledgeable, and good humored. Every employee who touched our table was professional and kind. And something I haven't experienced in a long time happened--the manager checked in with us at the end of our meal.\n\nThe chips are thick and warm. Three very different salsas for whatever your palate prefers. Watch out for the super spicy one!\n\nThe ceviche was delicious! Texturally on point and the right amount of citrus. Normally I don't like shrimp in my fish ceviche but the shrimp pieces were cut small and I actually enjoyed their addition.\n\nThe corn dish was also superb.\n\nThe drinks are good but I recommend starting during happy hour so they're not so expensive.\n\nCan't wait to go back and try the tacos.\n\nSubsequent visit:\nSocalo continues to delight me. The chips and salsa are mouth watering good. Great drinks. I always enjoy the ceviche. The carne asada tacos are good, though I did think the tortilla was chewy in a weird way--hard to bite off.\n\nThe service was just wonderful as usual.",
      "I visited Socalo two days in a row. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was and the service was five star. Thank you so much to Renata and Donald for making this a wonderful experience. They made good suggestions, they made any kind of accommodations happen.  The second day I visited with my cousin who had to bring his little dog because he had been attacked by coyotes a few days earlier and needed constant attention and they have us a really nice heated outside seat on the patio.  After the meal, Donald surprised us with a little dessert compliments of the house. Thank you again and I highly recommend this place. Didn't forget to take a picture with the flower wall as that was also suggested to us.",
      "UPDATE! June 2024\n\nCounter Service Only. You order, pay and then the staff will lead you to your table.\n\nI recommend reading the menu ahead of time, since there are a lot of good options, and there is only one line.\n\nWeekday Lunch specials are a good deal for $9.95 and  add $2 for a soda or ice tea. However,I ordered the Socalo Burrito/ chicken which comes with a beautiful salad, approximately $14. My friend ordered the shishito peppers and a bowl of tortilla soup. She enjoyed the shishito peppers, but the soup was a bit salty. I didn't taste it.\n\nThe food presentation is beautiful. The service, not so much. The soup and shishito peppers came out within minutes! My burrito took another 15 minutes. I found 2 chicken bones in the first 2 bites. I told my friend to eat and not wait for me, thank goodness.\n\nWe both only had ice water, and I asked for refills twice before getting my glass refilled. Granted it was lunch time, even when  the server acknowledged that I wanted water twice!\n\nWe both wanted to order the trio of sorbets but when we looked at the line to ORDER.... we decided to leave. Shame. I guess I could of ordered the sorbets when we placed our lunch order, but .....\n\nI am giving 4 stars total because the service and that this is no longer a Full Service restaurant.  I almost want to give them 3.5 stars, but ....\n--------------------------------\n\nThis review is for their Happy Hour! ( Wednesday - Saturday) They have Happy Hour Monday-Saturday.  The hours differ on Saturday ( 3-5pm). Parking is validated  for 90 minutes. Enter  the subterranean garage just south of Santa Monica Blvd.\n\nWe both loved the El Picante margarita for the hot spice kick! I also ordered the Chinola margarita which has passionfruit, mint and lime. The Chinola is smooth and sweet.\n\nI chose the Poblano Quesadilla and added chicken for $4 more.II forgot to take a photo, sorry.  It was perfect for my meal. I really liked all the flavors.\nMy friend ordered the Nopal Tostada, beautifully presented and tasty. She also ordered a Birria (lamb), and she enjoyed it.\n\nWe shared the Baked Nachos!!!  This was really a wonderful  textured tasty dish! Because  it was baked, the tortillas were crispy! I loved it!\n\nI recommend their Happy Hour Menu for food and drink!\n\nI returned to check out their all day and night Taco Tuesday!  The Taco Tuesday menu is fantastic! There are seafood, beef, pork, chicken and veggies options! The Taco Tuesday menu has more options than the Happy Hour menu ( Wednesday- Saturday) , and it 's all day and night ( during restaurant hours) so I would choose coming here for Taco Tuesday!",
      "A great experience and great food. We ordered the Queso spinach dip with chips. The chips are endless and we were only served in small portions so they were hot at all times!\nWe also ordered two tacos each, the Cana asada and the al pastor tacos. The meat was not chewy! It was a bit dry at time (Al pastor) and the ingredients did not really come together that well, but still great.\nEveryone was very friendly but we did have to ask for a refill on chips and water often. I would definitely recommend getting the chips with some sort of dip!",
      "Our dining experience was awesome. We attended The Other Art Show at Barkers Hanger in Santa Monica. After the show we were hungry. So we started looking for a place near by to grab a bite. We called a could of places and being a Friday night. We were failing. Then we called Socalo. The young lady was very nice and said if we were flexible. She has a table for us. We said yes. And off to Socalo we went. Pretty much from arrival to departure. We had wonderful customer service experience and delicious food. The tortillas and sauces are house made.\nThe staff was nice and attentive.\n\nWe can't wait to return..."

      "During a family vacation, we stumbled upon this gem one Friday night on the Santa Monica promenade. Surprisingly, the area was pretty quiet around 8 pm, and we were famished for a decent meal. After wandering for a bit, we finally stumbled upon a restaurant nestled on the corner, and to our delight, it was OPEN!\n\nWe were quickly seated, as the restaurant had only a few patrons. It offered a variety of seating options, including tables indoors and outdoors, as well as bar seating. Their menu featured what seemed to be authentic Italian cuisine, along with a separate menu of specials. Additionally, they boasted a full bar.\n\nI opted for a dish from the specials menu: Australian barramundi fish marinated in a creamy lemon and caper sauce, served on a bed of thick asparagus, spinach, and mashed potatoes\u2014absolutely delicious! My husband ordered a perfectly seasoned and sized steak, accompanied by equally hefty portions of asparagus and mashed potatoes. Meanwhile, our kiddo devoured a Margherita pizza, which was just the right size for us to sneak a bite or two.\n\nThe fish special exceeded all expectations. Despite my initial nerves about trying something new, it was expertly grilled and marinated, complemented by the lightly creamy caper sauce. The sauce perfectly coated the fish, which rested atop the bed of perfectly prepared asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was simply divine and tasted nothing like your typical fish dish.\n\nMy husband thoroughly enjoyed his steak, praising its seasoning and size. Paired with the asparagus and mashed potatoes, it was a satisfying and impeccably cooked meal.\n\nAs for the pizza, it was the only dish our kiddo finished during the trip\u2014clearly a testament to its quality.\n\nWe're already eagerly anticipating our next dinner at this wonderful restaurant!\n\nWalking distance. Affordable for a family of 3 with drinks.",
      "This local restaurant is perfect for a Happy Hour \ud83d\ude0a $13 delicious things crust pizza and great cocktails/beers, plus they have non-alcoholic cocktails!\nTheir calamari is really tender and properly cooked!",
      "Spacious upbeat Italian restaurant serving good California style pizza and other dishes. Salads are fresh and creative. Service was friendly and competent.",
      "Fabulous restaurant in a great location. If you're looking for a place where locals go that's off the beaten tourist track, Osteria is for you!  In addition to really great food, including a robust daily happy hour menu, seating choices include a semi-open indoor area, as well as both shaded and open patio spaces. As long time Santa Monica residents, we go here often to enjoy a quiet and lovely experience that reminds us why we live here.",
      "We have been to Osteria at least 6 times and for some reason I always forget to review this gem. I take my photos and there they sit. Maybe it is because I have so many that I put it off. I have not even attached half of them. We just love this place and will never stop coming back.\n\nOsteria is a fine dinning Italian eatery with a casual twist. You can go dressed  however you want and the place is full of natural light and ever so comfortable. It is super pretty inside and out. It is really just the perfect place to go for great food.\n\nThe service is just the best. Each time we have been there we are warmly greeted and the servers, we have had a few now, are amazing. They are all so kind and friendly. My grandson has a speech issue and the servers have always figured this out pretty fast. They are so patient because he really wants to tell you what he wants and not always have someone else talk for him. They  listen and understand, because they are listening, and will make whatever changes he may want, although he usually just loves the menu.\n\nEveryone that works there is super nice. They will ask you if you need anything, even is they are not your server. The bartenders have a smile you can see from your seat. They must just hire kind people.\n\nThe food is ever so great. Most of the pastas, maybe all, are made right there and they are perfect. They don't have a huge menu but everything they have is great. I think we have been through the entire menu at this point.\n\nAll of the pasta dishes are great and their fish is amazing. Everything is so fresh and perfectly cooked.\n\nThey also have the best bread. Now it is for a fee, but it is worth it. The last time we were there they did not have as many bread choices as they used to and I want them back. They make this bread with cheese that is so great, but alas, it was not to be when we were there last week. So, bring it back!\n\nThey also have super tasty desserts. All of them are great and we have shared them all. Again, the menu is not huge, just perfect.\n\nIt is not usually crowded because it is a large space. I would make reservations, but you don't need to. They have a great bar area with a TV and every drink you could imagine.\n\nThe place is always spotless. Parking is not the most fun, but you will find a space or just part in the public lot and walk about one quarter of a block.\n\nThe prices are high, but not insane. It is all worth it. Go there."

      "The service makes up for any other deficiencies.  Amidst flowing beer and a g\u00e9n\u00e9rally festive atmosphere, my wife and I asked for coffee and hot tea.

      "Wanted to like this place, but everything was under seasoned and cooked weird. The eggs on the Benedict were VERY over cooked, this was basically a hard boiled egg. Very little hollandaise, and the English muffins were sooo thin. Needed to wipe the plate edges from extra sauce from I guess the pan where the potatoes were cooked?, which would've improved presentation for sure - and the hostess said they weren't overly busy so this shouldn't have been an issue in my book. Again, not a big deal, but noticeable in addition to everything else. The potato hash begged for any amount of salt and frankly any seasoning at all. Service was fine, drinks were good, sitting outside was nice. If the food was better, I would go back - but sadly I don't plan to. I hope they read this and find ways to improve!",
      "Super cute brunch place with indoor and outdoor seating. Came for brunch and got the farmers breakfast and a caramel latte. Both were excellent. Highly recommend this place. Clean airy vibe.",
      "Went there for brunch. There were a good amount of people sitting and eating already when we arrived there. Ordered and paid at the cashier beforehand. They brought my coffee, drinks, and cheese cake first. They all good, tasty and yummy. But we waited main for 40mins, you may need to wait patiently. Breakfast burrito and farmers breakfast were good. Just potato was overly salted. I\u2019ll come back if service time was little faster. My advice is that please let your customer know if the food is coming late :)",
      "Yummy. Creme brulee late was a little sweet but still a good pick me up!\nOutdoor seating has good vibes.",
      "We went there on Sunday at around 10am and got a table inside without wait, but it got crowded short after. The food tasted great and the atmosphere was great too, but our orders were forgotten for half an hour, and they didn\u2019t notice it until we reminded them. Otherwise it was perfect."

      "Piccolo is one of the best restaurants on Lincoln for its delicious food, exquisite wines, and above-and-beyond friendly staff. The grilled octopus, grilled calamari, and linguini mare with the black in linguine are must-order dishes, and you really can\u2019t go wrong with any of the wines. Kelsey is the best manager and always makes sure things go smoothly. The bartender is also brilliant and all of his cocktails are amazing. They have both romantic indoor and outdoor seating, and I always leave with a smile on my face.",
      "This place is fantastic! What a little gem on Lincoln. The service is great with friendly service. The Pasta is homemade and AMAZING! High end meals at reasonable prices and great cocktails. Highly recommend this wonderful restaurant.",
      "Extremely friendly service here, and delicious food. It is a bit above my price range generaly, so I go there for a treat, and they have been unfailingly friendly.  The burrata and poached pair is cravable.  The pasta dishes are always delightful.  The salads are savory and refreshing.  They are happy to recommend wines to suit your tastes.  I enjoy both the outdoor and the indoor seating, and had a nice time at the bar once, where the bartender introduced me to a regular there.  This could be a nice place to just hang out if you lived in the area.  Can you believe this: once the host even offered to walk me to my home, a couple of blocks away, since it was late at night.  Hearwarmingly kind.",
      "The backyard is dimly lit and there are candles on the table, creating a memorable atmosphere. Heat lamps were more than adequate. Not loud, and not packed cheek to jowl, so it's easy to have conversations here. Very few kids here. The food was great quality, well prepared, good portion sizes, served warm. The fare is upper tier, traditional Italian, with little to no innovation. There are a few vegetarian choices but that's not a strength here. For dessert we tried tiramisu, which was mostly cream and lacked flavor. We didn't see our server all that much and had to ask another for a refill of water. The location is right on busy Lincoln, which unfortunately does not have much for public transit. Great place for a romantic dinner or other special occasion. I would probably come back.",
      "Everything on their menu is excellent. You're paying for quality of food and service. The staff is very friendly, professional, and attentive; they always make sure my glass of wine is never empty. Furthermore, the atmosphere is quiet and mellow; perfect, if you don't like to shout at everyone you talk to."

      "A sleek French spot! I came with a girlfriend and we split a bottle of wine and a few dishes. The food was super rich but flavorful. I enjoyed the pastries stuffed with cheese and the sea bass. Both were cooked excellent and I would order again. The waitress was super sweet and knowledgeable. Overall we had a great experience!",
      "The interior of this place is quite attractive and it's got a very good menu if you're into very classic French food, and aren't afraid of everything being very rich and buttery.\nI found the appetisers and hors d'oeuvres better than the mains, which were pretty heavy. The tartare, dauphinois and chicken liver was exceptional.\nA nice meal marred slightly by the service which was a but uncomfortable. The relentless upsell was a bit much.",
      "My wife and I have frequented Pasjoli numerous times, and with each visit, our appreciation for this gem in Santa Monica only grows stronger. From the moment you step inside, you're enveloped in a stunning ambiance that perfectly blends elegance with warmth.\n\nThe hospitality at Pasjoli is truly exceptional; every detail is thoughtfully attended to, from discreetly refilling our wine glasses to seamlessly clearing our table between courses. It's evident that the staff takes immense pride in providing a memorable dining experience.\n\nSpeaking of unforgettable experiences, the Tuna and Tomato dish at Pasjoli is nothing short of heavenly. The flavors and textures are perfectly balanced, leaving us dreaming about it long after we leave. If you have the chance, do not miss the Loup de Mer if it graces the menu. The lobster velout\u00e9 accompanying it is remarkably silky and bursting with flavor.\n\nAnd let's talk about desserts\u2014the chocolate souffl\u00e9 at Pasjoli is a masterpiece. Paired with cocoa nib ice cream that complements it flawlessly, it's the ideal conclusion to an exquisite meal.\n\nIn summary, Pasjoli is more than just a restaurant; it's an experience that keeps us eagerly looking forward to our next visit. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply craving exceptional cuisine, Pasjoli consistently delivers excellence that is hard to match. Highly recommended!",
      "Really love this restaurant. One of the best food crews on the West Coast, from a level of attention to detail on food and service. I think it was smart for them to loosen up a bit with a la carte service instead of traditional pre fixe for this tier of restaurants.\n\nLove the recent collaborations. Here are some shots of their recent event with Yangban.",
      "I was a returning customer and I had a terrible birthday dinner tonite. Me and my friend drove from OC on Tuesday night under heavy rain, when we got there it was not too crowded and it had few big tables available. Maybe waitress thought we wouldn\u2019t order too many so we got a tiny little place. Meanwhile there were another 2 groups with 2 parties came in same time, they got big tables, interesting. After we finished order, it\u2019s definitely too many for a tiny table but waitress even not asking if we need a bigger place. Unbelievable! And she checked several times for other tables but just 2 times for mine, I had to ask her for more water\u2026 back to food, I don\u2019t know what happened but every single course was way tooooo salty we barely to finish even half of the plates. And other tables had a quite long introduction about the main course ( the signature duck) but we only had 1 min briefing. The manager checked back to us and gifting us a free cheese cake which was sweet, thank you. But honestly it\u2019s just too late. I was too disappointed and rush to leave because I need get some other options before all restaurants closed. Total was $458 or $485( my friend paid the bill I couldn\u2019t remember clearly) for 2 ppl with cold service and awful food, I don\u2019t think you want same experience as mine. Btw we are Asians.\n\nUpdates:\nAnn, thank you for your sweet explanation with everything, first of all please be aware of, as customer service, I think your employee should have their judgements to check if customer needs a bigger table or could just kindly offer \u201c hey I think you might need a bigger place let me know if there\u2019s anything I could do for you\u201d I think this is more decent way as customer service especially as a M1 star restaurant. And as I mentioned during that time there\u2019s more than 1 bigger table available, there\u2019s nothing wrong if you guys can\u2019t offer a bigger table at that moment, but as better customer service I think you should and you could even just ask. I work as luxury retail I know what customer service is. About Waiter/ waitress checking, I strong recommended you check back with your camera see if I was telling a truth or I am creating drama. And way back to the food, I understand for some time somehow, it might happened the food was overcooked or over seasoning. But if the entire courses came with same issues, I think you should improve your quantity controlling instead of pointed that I was wrong or I declined your options. Because it\u2019s unacceptable if a M1 star restaurant had such issues. And forgive me I had no time to wait you guys re-cook everything. Because I don\u2019t need pay my time for your mistakes. Overall, thank you for your cheese cake again but good luck for your future business.\nHave a great night!"

      "Food was very good but the service was a disappointment. A pet peeve of mine is an improperly timed meal. All of our dishes were brought out nearly at once and at one point we had 4 of our 6 dishes delivered before we even finished our salad. The dining experience felt rushed, which is frustrating because the food was good.\n\nThey also have a 3% extra charge for using a credit card that they automatically add.",
      "One of the best restaurants I\u2019ve been to in Santa Monica! The cocktails were delicious, the service was great, and the food was incredible. Highly recommend the chef\u2019s choice. The food was super fresh and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. One of our new LA favorites!",
      "Have only been here to drink, though I've heard the food is really good too. What I can say for certain is that bar manager Kent is amazing, and his drinks don't disappoint! It's tough to find really creative and well executed cocktails on the Westside, but the bar at Isla is one of those places where you'll always discover that elusive amazing sip.\n\nAlso, they have Isla Noches on Fridays through the summer where they do a late night drinks and dance party from 10pm to late with drink specials, a dj, and dancing! (And if you're lucky maybe some flaming Dr. Pepper shots)",
      "The staff was so kind to squeeze us in on a busy weekend night. The atmosphere at Isla was very lively. I expect on a quieter evening, it would be a lovely place for a romantic dinner. Excellent beverage menu. Food is New American style with some unique flares. Make sure to check out their sister restaurant Crudo e Nudo!"

Like\u2026 maybe best mushrooms ever?\n\nPICKLE CHICKEN - 100% get this, because this is a home run.\n\nThe lamb and new york strip\u2026 meh. Quite good overall, but there are better things on the menu and I wouldn\u2019t recommend them.\n\nThe cocktails and service excellent too. Enjoy!",
      "I enjoyed almost everything I ate and drank. We had the cornbread, relish platter, rockfish, fried mushrooms, peas, rose pie, chocolate cake slice and a few drinks (5 total between the three of us).\n\nCornbread is delicious.\nI really like that they put the green chili in the butter. It shines more that way without overpowering the cornbread.\n\nLoved the platter. Didn't even know we could eat ice plant (?). It was such a nice texture. Everything was so good generally.\n\nThe fish was so well cooked. Just right and not too fishy (I think the ginger helped).\n\nThe peas were so fresh and yummy. I don't think it even needs cheese. I could eat it on its own.\n\nDrinks are solid and strong. Service from the maitre d to the server to the mixologist to the busboy was all consistently exceptional. The ambience is fantastic. I like that they don't try to squeeze in a million chairs. I think the overall design of the space also just feels airy.",
      "Food was average, we did enjoy the creativity and flavors of the relish plate and mussels. Matzo ball soup was flavorful but not mind blowing. Steak & fries seriously underwhelmed us, portion size was tiny. Our cocktails, however, were delicious and spirit-forward just like we were hoping for.\n\nService, however, was a MAJOR disappointment. We came for our 7pm reservation and saw the server only when he took our order and to deliver some of the dishes. It took 2 hours before our main course was delivered to us. Each time the server delivered our dish he apologized profusely for how long it was taking and stated he was embarrassed at the pace our dishes were coming out. The meal started off strong with our cocktails and two starters, but by the end, we were so disappointed by the service we decided to skip dessert and just go home.\n\nBummed because we really wanted to come back to try the pickle chick and other dishes/cocktails, but hard to justify coming back.",
      "The Matso ball soup is worth the trip \ud83d\udd25 The Caesar Fries were fried perfectly but a tad salty. The Empress Bundt cake was baked beautifully. The fresh whipped cream is perfect with the cake. I like the caramel but I found it overpoweringly sweet. More of a balance would have been nice. The restaurant decor is interior designer worthy and the location in Santa Monica is hard to beat!",
      "This place has an amazing vibe, food and service. The restaurant is Family style so food is meant to be shared with the table.\n\nThe half chicken is juicy, flavorful and well presented, same for the New York steak and the Cesar salad. Maybe the salad had too much dressing but that is just my preference. Also because of the concept of sharing the food, the price is very fair."

We ordered the Guacamole, Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, and Tuna Tartare as appetizers and they were all delicious. Possibly the best tuna I've had.

We'll be back",

      "Went here on Fathers' day 2024. The view was spectacular & the hostess had a nice disposition. She also had to bus our table prior to seating us. We got the lobster burger & Spicy Thai burger. The food & drinks were delicious & strong. I'd give them a 10/10. However, our server Jade was a 0/10. She took 10 min to come & acknowledge us. Meanwhile the party we checked in with had already ordered drinks with their server. We had to ask a bus person for water since Jade was MIA. She didn't even check on us once! We had to ask another bus person for a salt shaker & someone else re-filled our water glasses. JADE did absolutely NOTHING!  At these prices, service should be top notch! My friends who frequent this restaurant rave about the service so unfortunately, we must have gotten the one bad server they have. I'm usually a generous tipper but tipping Jade 10% was for the hostess & bus people who actually worked. I'd definitely come back for the view & food/drinks but never again subject myself to the poor service Jade exhibits! The poor service from Jade makes this restaurant less desirable when compared to similar establishments. There are too many other nice restaurants in LA that offer outstanding service, great food/drinks & beautiful aesthetics."

If you are one for flavored lattes, maybe try the caf\u00e9 de Olla with cream. It has a hint of spices like cinnamon in it and may be a great substitute for your flavored lattes. I like to visit places a few times before doing reviews to see the consistency of its work, so from this you can tell I have not been disappointed. It's highly recommended that you make reservations. Enjoy!"

      "This beautiful little place is right off of Wilshire Boulevard. Atmosphere and service absolutely fantastic. I ordered the fish tacos, which took a little while and were a little on a spicy side but overall, I will recommend this place. The menu selections were fast and appealing!",
      "I think I just had the best Burger ever. The meat was so good and juicy.\nI thought it couldn\u2019t get any better, I tried their dessert. I had the Peach Pudding and it blew my mind.",
      "Great place. Went for Happy Hour. Got the same delicious sauce on my chicken that they use with the short ribs dinner. Creative yummy food.",
      "This place is a GEM! Beautifully prepared, fresh, and creative flavors inside a beautiful atmosphere. I could not believe the variety of flavors in every dish that we tried! We got three happy hour specials (before 6pm) - the salmon collar, Brussels sprouts, and guacamole were all perfectly balanced in flavors and textures. At our table, we all agreed that the gazpacho was the best any of us had ever tasted. For entrees, we shared the duck breast and short ribs\u2026.although it took a half hour wait to come out, these dishes did not disappoint! The duck breast was especially special with a fantastic fruity sauce with Sichuan pepper flavors - a combination I didn\u2019t think would work well together but actually was an explosion of flavors. The duck breast was perfectly cooked rare. The short ribs had the juiciest meat and fell right off the bone, and came with the most delicious mashed potatoes. The only thing I would critique is that the short ribs were a bit salty (it seemed like it would go really well with a starch or maybe more plain steamed veggies) but honestly everything was beyond delicious and we will definitely be back again!",
      "We just got back from a fantastic dinner here. We arrived early so that we were able to order a lot items from their happy hour menu (way too many items since the portions were large), but as a result we got to taste six different appetizers/entrees before we had our main courses. Everything was delicious especially the Brussels sprouts. Additionally the duck and the steak were amazing. The prices were quite reasonable in light of the quality of the preparation and presentation. This is a must do experience."

      "We loved the lamb chops and seafood pasta. Didn\u2019t like the risotto with lobster. Loved that they had mocktails\u2026i got the pomogracoloada which was yummy. We also ordered sangria and a spicy margarita. Calamari was okay. Service was good. However, we felt that the owner was racist which was a shame because we spent our money here. As someone who just recently travel from Italy, i wouldn\u2019t say this is that comparable. It\u2019s just okay.",
      "This place has been on my list, and finally, I experienced it last night for a late bday celebration.\n\nIt's a gem.\n\nValet parking was $15\nWe sat in the corner right pocket right next to the entrance. I never got up to explore the other areas, so I'll just have to come back.\n\nThe service was truly great! From the gentleman who poured our water, to the waiter, to the gentlemans that cleared our plate.\n\nEach individual was given bread after placing our orders. It was delicious and we asked for more. We ordered the following.\n\nIl Cesare\nIl Polipo\nFunghi Porcini\nPappardelle Al Cinghiale\nSalmone\nPollo Arrosto\n\nBirthday Dessert (most popular)\nCuore Di Cioccolata\n\nMy favs were the polipo and Porcini! I was pleasantly surprised at how good the salad was. Even more so with the polipo. The octopus was so tender and very well seasoned. I couldn't get enough of the potatoes as well.\n\nI ate most of the Porcini and was full off that before realizing that my friend ordered 3 other main dishes. I'm biased as I love mushrooms. The porcini had so much flavor and is honestly one of the best I've tried. I loved that there were a lot of mushrooms with every bite. I'd come back for this because it hit the spot for me.\n\nEverything was delicious on its own. My next fav was the Pappardelle! The boar was again very well seasoned and flavorful. Noodles were flat and thin, perfectly cooked with the right amt of firmness for each bite.\n\nLastly, the dessert was a super cute aesthetic with a perfectly written happy birthday. It was thick and sweet. Heavy for a meal with what we ordered. It was a delight to try, but I would try another dessert next time.",
      "Wonderful place. I love outdoor dining so this place definitely made the cut. Food was great and the service was awesome. The ambiance:  serene and quite relaxing.\nWe are going back to dine again soon!",
      "Had our first dinner as a wedded couple here and everything was amazing. Staff made us feel extremely special. The food was sublime (pre-fixe), especially the Homemade Pappardelle with Maine Lobster and White Truffle Sauce.",
      "I've been there as just a guest for the New Year celebration of 2024, I was so amazed by the kitchen and service that I decided to celebrate my wedding at this place also.\n\nThey rent nice private rooms for any amount of people 20+++ and offer everything you need for a special occasion.\nIn my case, it was a nice pre-fixed menu, which is AMAZING!!! the best appetizers in my life, lobster truffle pasta, lamb and more!!\n\nil Cielo decorated the place for me with flowers,\nDecorated a wedding case\nBoth of the decorations were unbelievable!\n\nPasquale personally was guiding me through from process from the beginning to the end.\n\nI'm infinitely happy I decided to do that, from the 1st day working with Pasquale I forgot about multiple tasks that need to organize your wedding (chef, plate\\glass rent, florist, etc). We decided everything within 1 day and I was set up. Amazing!\n\nNow I feel like I am connected to this place, we will come back for ever anniversary celebration!"

      "Breakfast solid 2.9 / 5.0 - Just meh food with attentive but sloppy service.\nFor breakfast food like this I can just go to a diner. It's quite un-special and lacks flavor. Bacon is basically deep fried to a crisp, eggs & pancakes were basic but fine, everything else was fine. Coffee tastes good but was just seemed like the waiter didn't care, was very rushed (even though they weren't busy) and twice over poured coffee and didn't return to clean it up.\nDidn't care for the style of the waiter (rushed and disinterested, seemed like he doesn't enjoy job) but the helpers were great. Nice white table clothes and nice setting.",
      "The ambiance was superb, and the beef patty in the hamburger was juicy and delicious \u2013 I loved it! Several of my Chinese friends who were with me are fluent in Spanish, so they directly communicated with the Latin American server in Spanish. The server was very friendly and even provided complimentary bread before the meal.",
      "We had a great time at this bistro, because of their delicious desserts. The service was friendly, and our order came quickly. The Black Out Dark Chocolate Cake was absolutely delightful and my favorite among the desserts we tried.",
      "Excellent food and very nice service. Good price performance ratio.",
      "I\u2019m visiting the area and saw the menu here and had to try. This place was absolutely spectacular. Everyone was so kind and attentive, and the food was to die for! 100% recommend to try out. The outside dining area was so comfortable and it is in a beautiful spot in the Beverly Hills area.

They also have a very large bar area, which include a vast selection of other great alcoholic beverages. This restaurant offers a cheese section, uniquely selected for purchase along with other products. The food is so tasteful and has beautiful presentation. My only complaint is the stools not being comfortable. This casual ambiance is a perfect place for lunch or dinner. You definitely must put Wally\u2019s on your list next time you visit Beverly Hills.",
      "This restaurant did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious. I loved every bit of it!\n\nThe restaurant itself has a great ambiance and is filled to the brim with wines, literally lining every single wall up to the ceiling. If you sit in the back like we did, you get a view into the open kitchen and watch the magic happen.\n\nThe standouts for me were the truffle fries and the lobster pasta which was heavy for sure, but very very good. It was a squid ink pasta in a delicious lobster sauce with quite a bit of seafood. The truffle fries were perfectly cooked and reminded me of belgian fries almost.\n\nThis is a must try! Will be back here for dinner for sure when I'm in LA.",
      "We recently attended a party at Wally's Beverly Hills, and it was an exceptional experience. Located near Rodeo Drive, Wally's offers an upscale yet inviting atmosphere perfect for any gathering.\n\nWe sampled nearly everything on the menu, and each dish was a culinary delight. The charcuterie and cheese boards were a highlight, featuring an impressive selection of high-quality, artisanal products. The seafood dishes, particularly the oysters and lobster, were fresh and perfectly prepared.\n\nFor mains, the truffle pasta stood out with its rich, earthy flavors, and the steaks were cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. The diverse wine list, expertly curated, complemented our meal wonderfully, adding to the overall indulgence.\n\nService was attentive and knowledgeable, ensuring our needs were met promptly and with a smile. Wally's is a gem in Beverly Hills, offering a memorable dining experience that combines elegance with outstanding food and drink.",
      "First time at Wally's last night and had the best time. Bartenders were so friendly and helpful with ordering from menu. I got the avocado salad that was seriously one of the best salads I've ever had. So colorful and fresh. We then shared the spicy pepperoni pizza that was also fresh and had the perfect kick to it. This is definitely my favorite restaurant right now. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. This restaurant deserves ten stars!",
      "Wally's is a Beverly Hills Must! (January 2024)\n\nWe recently were shopping in Beverly Hills and the associate at the boutique we were at recommended Wally's for an afternoon drink + snack.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were already in-love with the atmosphere - wine bottles up and down the walls and you get to eat/enjoy in the middle of it all.\n\nA few cocktails later, charcuterie board and the must-have black truffle baked brie bread... we were very satisfied with the visit/recommendation! The staff were also very nice and made great recommendations on food + drink."

The menu is so extensive its almost overwhelming, but everything we got was good. I had a lovely lunch here.",
      "BEVERLY HILLS STAPLE- one of our favorite spots for a special night out. This restaurant is beautiful and the staff cares about every detail. Our dinner was delicious.

      "My husband took me to Spago as a surprise to celebrate my birthday. What a treat!\n\nThe service was impeccable. It is clear from the moment you park the car in front of Spago that every single staff member strives for excellence.\n\nWe were seated in a comfortable booth inside and enjoyed seeing the lighting changing as the sun set happened late. The ambiance is sophisticated, yet comfortable.\n\nWe felt very lucky to have an extremely kind and sweet server named Rita. Her assistants (who brought in the food, the drinks, removed empty dishes, lit up my birthday candle) were also kind and professional. They all brought a feel of being happy to be there in that given moment.\n\nAs for dinner, I'll name my favorite dishes:\n* the tuna cones\n* the branzino (I think the best I ever had)\n* the peach strudel (inspired) dessert\n\nI appreciated the personalized touch of having my name written following the \"happy birthday\" wish with our dessert.\n\nMr. Wolfgang Puck came to greet us at our table at the start of the evening, which was quite sweet.\n\nAs we were walking to leave the restaurant, many of the staff members thanked us and wished us a good rest of the evening.\n\nImpeccable, from beginning to end, with the addition of a follow up email on the following day.",
      "The experience was remarkable. Reservations are strongly advised as the establishment appears to anticipate your arrival with additional amenities. The dishes were flawlessly prepared, and the flavors were exceptional. I highly recommend Spago.",
      "What a great and iconic restaurant to visit while in LA.   Staff is all super friendly and welcoming and our server Josh was fantastic.  His recommendations were on point based on the types of foods my wife and I prefer.  So glad we made this stop a priority while visiting Southern California.  Amazing and worth every penny.",
      "To celebrate Mother's Day, we chose Spago in Beverly Hills, a decision that proved to be exceptional in many ways. The ambience was refined and inviting, perfect for a special occasion.\n\nThe service at Spago is unparalleled \u2013 attentive, knowledgeable, and always with a smile. The wine list is extensive and carefully curated, with our server making excellent recommendations. We paired our meal with the Donnachadh Ros\u00e9 of Syrah 2023, which was light, and refreshing, and complemented our dishes perfectly.\n\nOur meal began with their famous bread and salsas, setting a high bar right from the start. We also enjoyed the Spicy Big Eye Tuna Cones, featuring sesame, ginger, wasabi, chilli aioli, and daikon sprouts. These were as delicious as I remembered from my previous visit \u2013 a perfect balance of spice and freshness.\n\nFor our main courses, we indulged in the Liberty Farm's Duck Breast, which was beautifully cooked and paired with caramelized endive, kumquat marmalade, candied walnuts, and a spiced duck jus. The flavours were exquisite, each component enhancing the duck without overpowering it. We also tried the chicken and the Chilean sea bass, both of which were prepared to perfection, showcasing the quality of the ingredients and the chef's skill.\n\nDesserts at Spago are nothing short of spectacular. Being a special occasion we let ourselves be recommended for Mother's Day but we will return to try everything we can.\n\nSpago remains a top choice for fine dining in Beverly Hills. From the exceptional service and wine list to the delightful starters and exquisite entrees, and the unforgettable desserts, every aspect of our Mother's Day celebration was perfect. Highly recommended for any special occasion.\n\nSpago remains a top choice for fine dining in Beverly Hills. Highly recommended for any special occasion. However, I have to say, this visit was Allegro Ma Non Troppo. We've enjoyed the concept of Spago's kitchen on many previous occasions, having dined there numerous times before. Unfortunately, this time wasn\u2019t the best experience.",
      "We flew in from Australia. Attentive staff, waitress and maitre'd. Extensive wine menu to cater all palates. The food was absolutely delectable. The signature dishes were the highlights including spicy big tuna cones and salmon pizza with the ever crisp dough. A must try is the Singapore style black pepper  Branzino.Will definitely come again."

Not much of an ambiance. Pricing was reasonable. Food and drinks were tasty but nothing spectacular. Great location to walk around and explore after dining.",
      "The service was efficient and friendly. Our food came pretty quickly, and it was some of the most delicious pasta and pizza we have tried! Definitely recommend it for a nice, relaxed lunch in an authentic atmosphere.",
      "I walked in to this place since the review looks high in google and the price is decent considering the area. However, the waiter who served us is very rude and racist. He offered us to order bread and when I asked what kind of bread, his reply was \u201cOf course Italian bread, no Asian bread here. Ciabatta\u201d, with a smiley face and giddy tone. When I said I\u2019m okay he also replied \u201cOf course you are ok, I\u2019m not a doctor\u201d. I found that these comments are unnecessary and unprofessional. He quickly gathered the menu when I\u2019ve just ordered one item, although we were planning to order more. I guess they were very busy, albeit some empty seats observed. I asked him for more water since they didn\u2019t offer any, and he jokingly replied that it will take an hour. Upon seeing my frown, he said ok and quickly refilled the water. When I mentioned that an hour passed by quickly. He said \u201cOf course that is how we do things here\u201d. Boy am I glad that I didn\u2019t live here then. I was dissatisfied with the service so we left less than 18% tips. The bill came out to be $95 and we gave them $100 bill. He was asking for 15% more. I thought tip was more of a courtesy and not an obligation? We added an extra $10 bill as per his request. The food was ok, but I guess the terrible service is the price we must pay for having an affordable Italian food amidst Rodeo Drive.",
      "Came here for the second time to dine, really love the ambiance. The service staff is very polite, the coffee is fantastic, and the freshly baked pizza is excellent. I particularly enjoy the olive oil with Italian balsamic vinegar for the bread before the meal.",
      "About 4-5 years since I was here.  The vibe completely off.  Food good but service and overall ambience lost or cold. Had to ask for water - not even offered it & bread used to be complimentary / when I queried it the reply was \u201coh that was pre-pandemic\u201d.  That is just sad.   Read the play people -  the salmon portion for the extra $16 was insulting.   Arriverderci Il Fornaio."

The seafood is always top-notch, and the warm, inviting service makes the meal even more enjoyable.\n\nThe attention to detail from both the kitchen and the staff is evident, making each visit a memorable one. Whether you\u2019re celebrating a special occasion or just indulging in a great meal, Crustacean continues to exceed expectations. I can\u2019t recommend it enough!",
      "We did the Dine LA. Great way to try this restaurant.  The courses were all good. Slow paced which I liked. Service was good throughout. I hear it looked nicer before the remodel. It was simply designed I thought.",
      "We came for a birthday celebration. I hadn't been to this restaurant in years but the service was still impeccable and the food delicious.  It's a typical Beverly Hills restaurant so don't expect a lot of food for your dollars.  We were all still hungry after the 6 of us spent almost $900!! (Yes. $900!). But again, everything was great.  Drinks are tasty and unique but not very strong.  Vegan garlic noodles were delicious with the heart of palm crab cake and the beef.  Don't know if I'll be going back any time soon unless someone is treating me though.  The atmosphere is lovely especially with the open patio area.",
      "Outrageously priced for terrible food, sorry to say. This beautiful restaurant that has been in business for over two decades and has good reviews by some, it was a failure in my opinion.\nLoved the atmosphere (floor designed aquarium, beautiful color theme\u2026). Tastefully designed setting, with great service. However that where the positive features end. The waiter was explaining various options on the menu, and one of them that caught our attention was, \u201cmulti generation secret recipe\u201d part. Naturally, we decided to try this secret. The fried rice was bland devoid of any Asian spices, the noodles were lacking the flavor one would expect of any Asian dish. The fried eggplants were okay. The crab was definitely overrated. No soups on the menu (soup options are always good idea, especially when the weather is still cold). The vanilla ice cream was melting upon arrival and the coconut flavor was left out of the coconut ice cream. Not worth $750 for party of four.",
      "My family, visiting Beverly Hills for the first time, sought an upscale and memorable brunch experience during a weekday. Making a reservation at this restaurant was a breeze, even during the busy lunch rush hour. The detail-oriented and brilliant five-star wait staff ensured our service was prompt, which we appreciated given the tight schedules of relatives working nearby. Several of us opted for the brunch specials, while I followed the host\u2019s recommendation. The food was beautifully plated and met very high culinary standards, and I particularly enjoyed their coffee, a welcome treat before my 6-hour drive to the Bay Area. However, the brunch offerings didn't quite meet my expectations and seemed to pale in comparison to what I suspected might be available for lunch or dinner. Despite this, the beautiful atmosphere, friendly staff, and seamless service nearly made for a complete five-star experience. I\u2019m quite sure I\u2019d return to try their dinner menu\u2014if I can manage to get a reservation!"

As we were ordering tempted, and you know, I was eating oysters, steak, appetizers, and popcorn ice cream don't let the price points scare you off because this place is worth every time you spend. All the food that I have posted was for only two of us and we ate every ounce of it.",
      "As a local who works in the neighborhood, I love coming here for dinner with friends! It\u2019s definitely our \u201cGo-To\u201d spot where everyone is happy with the food, the drinks & the service. Last night we were fortunate enough to have MICHELLE as our server. She truly IS A GEM!!!! I would probably be very sad if Michelle ever left because the pride she takes in providing excellent service is second to none. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to get her, she will guide you through the menu to help you make the best decisions! Everyone else is good too, she just goes above & beyond!\n\nIt\u2019s against my religion to NOT order:\n-The Ribeye (ask them to slice it if you\u2019re sharing with others). We usually opt for the heated plates as well. Can\u2019t go ring with rare to medium rare. The dry aged is good too, same with the cap!\n-The Corn Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is crack in the best way (maybe not the best if you\u2019re trying to avoid sugar & butter, but all things in moderation)! I don\u2019t event want to try to make it at home. It\u2019s torched to perfection.\n\nOther staples that I really enjoy:\n-Escargot\n-Deviled Eggs\n-Fried Lobster\n-Seafood Tower (Lobster, Alaskan Crab Legs, Oysters, Stone Crab and the Shrimp Cocktail) all amazing!\n-Beet Salad\n-Shrimp Popcorn\n-Brussels Sprouts with Bacon\n-Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms\n\nMy absolute drink of choice is their dirty martini with 3 blue cheese stuffed olives!",
      "Steak 48 in Beverly Hills, you've stolen my heart! From the moment I made the reservation, I knew we were in for a treat. The confirmation call was like a warm hug, setting the tone for an exceptional dining experience. And then, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance - the bread! Heavenly doesn't even begin to describe it. Our party of steak lovers was in awe, with each cut cooked to perfection. The sides? Generous enough to feed a small army (we shared, of course!). But what truly set Steak 48 apart was the service. Our server (sorry, name escapes me, but you know who you are!) was a rockstar! And the cherry on top? A post-dinner thank-you call! Talk about delightfully old-school charm. 10/10, would steak again (and again, and again...). Can't wait to try your other locations!",
      "Michelle was excellent & thorough. She asked if it was our first visit to Steak 48. She provided an overview of the menu & shared with us her personal favorites.  The service here was off the chart. Will, the manager, came by our table to confirm if everything was okay. We were a party of 4, 3 of us ordered different steaks. All were cooked to order & tasted great.  For a starter, I recommend the wagyu beef tartare. It was exceptional.",
      "Decided to try out this new steak house for my birthday! I\u2019ve done Mastros I\u2019ve done Ruth Cris, all of the ones in the area but this was a different amazing experience overall! From when I checked the hostess\u2019s gave me a warm welcome. The ambient was very old money New York. I love that the bathrooms are single so you can take as many pictures as you want. From the complementary bread to the cocktails to the steak, everything was made to perfection. I forgot my servers name but he\u2019s was amazing as well gave me a run down on the menu and guest favorites. Everyone was very sweet, that\u2019s a big thing for me and everyone was so nice made my experience so much sweeter. For 1 person I paid 190. Mind you it is family style so the portions were on the the bigger side. The shrimp must try! The bone in is the way to go. I had the pomegranate martini and it had me feeling right! Amazing restaurant with great service and even better food. Thank you will definitely be back very soon (:"

      "I recently dined at this restaurant with my son. He ordered the 12-ounce New York steak, requesting it to be cooked medium. Unfortunately, it arrived rare and undercooked, with visible blood. The steak's taste was subpar, and the string fries were burnt and inedible. Although the ambience was beautiful and the service excellent, the food was a major letdown. This experience merits a 1 out of 10. The meal was extremely overpriced, and we will not be returning. If you want to enjoy your food, steer clear of this place.",

      "Best place to spend your night.\nTop qualities food with best in class service \u2026.\nOne of the best place on Beverly Hills \u2026..\nSeriously recommend to take your friends and family members to hangout \u2026.\n\nEven employees who works there are highly trained and professional .

      "Came here to celebrate our anniversary, ended dinner on a elated note. Everyone was super friendly here, even the other neighboring parties surrounding our table. We even witnessed a proposal. \ud83e\udd73\n\nThe staff here is stellar. Super courteous, extremely helpful explaining, a different level of service.\n\nThe vibe is classy old school and the environment is warm. The price meets the quality standard without compromise.\n\nThe food and drinks are exactly how we expected. The coffee gelato dessert was extremely delicious.\n\nYou can park anywhere in the public structures around Rodeo Drive."

Specially the blackened salmon salad. My husband enjoy his Blackened Snapper that he said be was speechless. We really had a great time here.",

      "Love this place! The place is a vibe and the staff is attentive and nice.\nGot there pretty early. We didn't have a reservation so we sat the lounge area. It's was still Happy hour. There was a $10 drink menu do I had the Black Orchid. It was delicious!!\nI got the ahi tuna and it was prepared perfectly. The creamed spinach was good also.

      "My Daughter took me to Ocean Prime for Brunch on father\u2019s Day!  Food was Amazing! Atmosphere amazing and ambiance amazing!  10 out of 10. 5 Stars",
      "I have been to other Ocean Prime locations and had a great meal during each of those visits, but I would say this Beverly Hills location is probably my favorite overall. The flavors were as great as I remembered and I just loved how upscale and well done the specific location is. Erik, our server, was absolutely fantastic and really made the meal a better one. Inside is especially large, open, and kept dark which is really nice because it felt like your conversation was more private. They really space out the tables so it didn\u2019t feel like everyone was overlapping each other in terms of conversations. They don\u2019t have a parking lot and street parking is quite hard to find in this part of town so your best option will be their valet for $15 or a nearby parking garage for $10.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Ocean Prime is their large and diverse menu. There is something for everyone here. I started off with the Lobster Bisque because it\u2019s one of my favorite bisques that I have had at any restaurant. This one was as good as all the others. Next I followed up with the Steak Tartare, and it was fantastic. The soft crostini was a great vehicle for the tartare. For my entr\u00e9e, I chose the Chilean Seabass and although I wish that portion of fish was a bit larger, it still was delicious. I especially liked the truffle vinaigrette on top. I was going to do the Warm Butter Cake that I\u2019ve had in the past, but at this point in the meal I was just too full.\n\nOverall a fantastic seafood and contemporary American restaurant in a beautiful part of town. It is a bit expensive, but it\u2019s certainly worth it. I would recommend to anyone for any occasion."

      "What a superb restaurant - if you are in or near Rodeo Dr., you must visit this place. Excellent in everything; location service and atmosphere.  Cannot say much about the food - we ordered calamari and shrimp, lobster spaghetti, and 208 burgers; all taste sooo delicious. I would say that the lobster \ud83e\udd9e and spaghetti is my super favorite dish.\n\nI will definitely come back again - I highly recommend.",
      "We found this restaurant 209 Rodeo Restaurant during our shopping walk along Rodeo Drive. Despite the fact that we did not have a reservation, they found a free table for us. We sat outside on the terrace. We chose salmon with salad, hamburger and pasta from the menu. The service was helpful-a little forgetful, but we didn't wait long for the food. The food was delicious and the atmosphere pleasant. The surroundings of the restaurant were also very nice. More on Instagram @larmarluxury.",
      "Parking: There is a parking garage on Rodeo and Dayton that provides quick access to the restaurant. After 6pm, you can park for a $10 fee. The walk from the garage to the restaurant is pleasant. Although it\u2019s a short distance, you\u2019ll walk by a number of the finest luxury designer boutiques.\n\nReservations: Reservations were not only easy to book, but available at short notice. There is no fee for lateness or cancellation. Upon arrival, I stated that I had a reservation, but I think I would\u2019ve been seated just as quickly had I not.\n\nService: There was a waiter nearby at all times to assist us with our needs whether It be placing an order, refilling water, asking for the bill or directions to the bathroom. I think this also has to do with our seating, We sat directly outside the restaurant, therefore all waiters/waitresses , busboys and host needed to walk past us often. The outdoor fridge containing desserts and sparkling water was directly across from our table, making service quick.\n\nFood: In this day and age, many restaurants are charging for bread and some are not even offering It at all. 208 Rodeo hasn\u2019t abandoned the bread option, but does charge an extra $12 for truffle butter.\n\nWe ordered the 208 Burger. This includes a Wagyu blend, caramelized onion, sharp cheddar, truffle aioli,\u00a0brioche bun, garlic\u00a0fries. This fries were thinly sliced. The burger is filling and is enough to satisfy you if eating It alone.\n\nI ordered a side of Truffle Mac and Cheese. The portion size was small and It lacked salt. Both the salt and Mac and Cheese were finished the next day as leftovers. Once adding a bit more salt to the Mac and Cheese, the taste improved dramatically.\n\nMy guest ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese. This was toothsome, but why pay $36 for an appetizer lobster Mac and cheese, if you can have a half Maine lobster tail for six dollars less or a lobster spaghetti for $12 more.\n\nComfort: This restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating allows you to enjoy dinner while watching the sunset. There are outdoor heaters provided that will absolutely keep you warm.\n\nOverall, this is a beautiful restaurant. You have the option to eat indoor or outside. It\u2019s pretty easy to snag a reservation here and the ease of parking makes It a much more accommodating experience. I would definitely recommend this place for a date night.",
      "Excellent restaurant in the \u2665\ufe0f of the Rodeo Drive, just next to the photo-spot No.1; which is very entertaining to watch \ud83d\ude0e. The service is absolutely to and the food fantastic. We did have lobster \ud83e\udd9e & Caesar\u2019s Salat. We will be back for sure \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0b; it\u2019s on the rather costly side \ud83d\udcb8 but definitely worth it!"

Highly recommend the cannellini bean soup and the smoked trout salad. I also had the gnocchi and it was delicious but rich. However the portion was perfect for lunch. Fries (they ask if you want slim cut or thick!!) were perfect. Also, on the table they leave whole lemons and a knife so you can add citrus to your water! So LA! We were hotel guests but I would recommend for anyone. A stylish venue but not stuffy; very welcoming. They actual terrace is perfect for a warm day.",

Food is also good but nothing to rave about. Service is great. I had the burger with fries. Fries were really thin and small for my taste",
      "They made a mistake and overcharged us by 54$. We paid and we left, then in 1 minute I realized that it is a lot and we went back. We were still in the lobby, near the entrance of the restaurant. When I asked May I get our receipt, they said , ohhh we know that we made a mistake and we overcharged you.\nExcuse me, you knew about this mistake and you did not chase us to give us money back??? You knew it from the beginning. It is called stealing money. How could it be at such place?\nPicture is as a proof that I visited you.",
      "Went for brunch. The food was very plane but very overpriced. The service was absolutely awful, waited 15 min before someone came and gave us water and had to ask 5 times. And of course the included 20% tip automatically! Overall I will not be back!"

Amazing patio and indoor spaces inside the Crescent hotel. Can\u2019t wait to try their breakfast, brunch and lunch menus.

Wish I could come back one day.\n\nWe went there on our bikes and they don\u2019t have a spot where you can park the bikes but the hotel next door did have a pole where we left our bikes while eating. It is Beverly Hills priced but we had a great time!",

      "Our dining experience on 7/29 was mixed. The restaurant ambiance is wonderful. We had two servers due to some schedule transition. Our first one was great; our second one was pretty hands off. She also didn\u2019t seem to know what was going on, asking us if we wanted to order dessert while we were waiting for our entrees to arrive.\n\nMare Misto: 5/5\nVery crispy calamari and rock shrimp\n\nCannellini bean salad: 4/5\nPretty good but underseasoned\n\nPappardelle Al Ragu: 5/5\nDelicious\n\nSteak frites: 2/5\nOvercooked; skimpy on the chimichurri, fries were crispy but not seasoned at all\nFor $78, we would expect the chef to be able to cook it to the correct temperature so this was a major disappointment. Since it took so long, we just ate it since we didn\u2019t have time to have them remake it.\n\nNon-alcoholic cosmojito: 2/5\nThis was mostly ice and not a good value for $15. It was maybe a couple ounces of cranberry juice and Perrier decorated with ice and mint leaves and citrus slices.",
      "I had been to two locations in NYC before but was pleasantly surprised by this location in Beverly hills. We just walked in and were able to get a table on a Thursday. Very high class and amazing drinks as always. We love the Negroni. The calamari was okay. Overall my experience here is that it\u2019s better for drinks. I have not tried many items though so I plan to do that next time I go. You will get an amazing view of the city too.",
      "EDIT: MAY 2024 Dante invited me back to make this right, I appreciate that effort from their crew and it\u2019s clear they took my feedback on board (see my new cauliflower pic) thank you Dante for being so responsive.\n\nI\u2019ve been to Dante a few times now, both in New York and Beverly Hills. For the BH location, I was last here Nov of 2023 for context and now Feb 2024 which is when this review was written.\n\nFirst off, the cocktails are always delicious. The service team does an amazing job at making sure your drink experience is top notch, no matter what you order. And the ambiance is always pretty too, no matter the time of day you visit - with comfy booths/chairs and a wonderful view.\n\nNow onto the food, which is the main reason for this review today. I am glad to see Dante offer so many vegan options (yay and thank you!) When I come, I normally order the cauliflower as my entree, which in the past has been delicious, filling and very flavorful. Tonight when I ordered this dish, it was a very different story. The portion was not only what felt like 1/3 of the size but also cold in the middle. (I am Including photos for reference of this difference in size). Yet, the price of this dish has not changed. I am just really taken aback at the vast difference in experience regarding this entree in the times I have ordered it.\n\nFor Dante\u2019s level of service, prices and experience, I hope they can correct this for future guests who may want to order the cauliflower.",
      "Did not disappoint. We came during lunch which is a different vibe entirely than evening service & drinks, but I was pleasantly surprised with the ambience, food, and service. It is on the 9th floor and across from the Maybourne Pool with a light food menu. Views over BH are great and I love the patio seating.\n\nOur server Gabriel was lovely, polite, and attentive. I was celebrating my niece\u2019s graduation and birthday, and he brought out adorable non-alcoholic minis which I genuinely appreciated. We got the Diavolo pizza and burrata as a little snack and it was good.",
      "Lovely place, a little difficult to locate because it's located on the 9tb floor. Only street parking if you get lucky. The service was great, however I asked 3 people for a straw and they seem to forgot everytime I came to the table. Luckily a waiter filling my water made my straw wish come true finally! On the flip side they made my birthday very special and the place definitely has great welcoming vibes. I would definitely return again and recommend \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe."

      "Restaurant has ZERO regard for the importance of caution around allergies. Myself and another guest at my table, both specifically asked for \u201cNO salami\u201d and stated allergies. Yet both of our salads had salami. General manager, Armando, stated, \u201cit\u2019s only a couple pieces. We\u2019re very busy. Are you a mother? Enjoy your Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d When I stated this is a health concern, he replied callously, \u201cif anything happens to you let us now.\u201d Our waiter, Guissepi, then stated \u201cit\u2019s ok.\u201d To which I again reiterated \u201cit\u2019s not ok.\u201d Suffice it to say, I did not eat anything after the salad was sent back as I can\u2019t trust an establishment that has no regard for allergies.",
      "Food was good, atmosphere was excellent, service was amazing, I tried fried calamari, squid ink risotto and margarita pizza.",
      "I had a wonderful experience here both times I\u2019ve been! The staff is always so nice and make you feel like you\u2019re one of a kind. HIGHLY recommend the calamari appetizer. Will definitely be back and bring friends!",
      "A very pleasant restaurant with excellent cuisine, a wide range of cocktails and friendly staff. For every recommendation."

      "Amazing little spot\nOur server David was such a gem- so so kind and nice!\n\nMenu is wonderfully crafted and food was amazing\n\nIced latte was delicious!!\n\nIf you want to sit outside there is a minimum 50$ spend per person which is okay, as that is the general meal cost",
      "Very Authentic Valentine's Time Meal Sets!  Everything is perfect to me.  I requested no salt and sauce on the side.  The server is so professional, he took good care of us.  When the sauce has no salt, he asked the chef place the sauce with the foods, if there is salt in sauce, then sauce on the side.  Even the sauce has no salt, it is still so delicious.  It is so amazing!  We will definitely come back in the future.",
      "JAZZ IS NOT DEAD\n\nCame here for my birthday last Sunday for brunch. From start to finish \u2014 the experience is elegant. Jeff was our waiter and said \u201cfifth is the new 18.\u201d\n\nThe photos explain the experience. Live jazz music, now wait, parking across the street is 2 hours free, I paid $5.\n\nFood is excellent,  especially the burger with the marrow infused. The barbecue sauce was delicious and not really \u201cketchup like in consistency.\u201d The dessert is amazing \u2014 whip cream is fresh (no fridge taste like another high end hotel I had been to in May on the east coast). I love the detail of the thinly rolled white chocolate dyed with raspberry juice shaped like a candle\u2026 cannot figure how the patisserie chef created that. Dessert reminds me of Patti Jinich\u2019s James Beard Award Mexican recipe, except I never tasted hers. This was healthier abd beautiful. In one of the patisserie, there is some ice cream surrounded by fresh whipped cream.\n\nCrouton on the Caesar salad was shredded to not overpower the pepitas. Dijon has turmeric, no white wine, therefore softer. Mayonnaise uses safflower oil and real eggs (I.e. soybean oil typically has a flavor).\n\nHot water served in a German (probably Boden) double-wall glass.\n\nThe take home coffee used a paper lid. I tested the cup two more consecutive days and it is sustainable, not coated with chemicals. All paper packaging that doesn\u2019t soak through because of its texture.\n\nOn the way in or out, check out the stunning chandelier and bouquet of flowers. This is the hotel where \u201cPretty Woman\u201d was filmed and I believe that the human-operated elevator still works.\n\nThey have the best desserts, lots of effort for minimal price\u2026 I\u2019ll try to find the Mother\u2019s Day dessert. Mikimoto next door \u2014 gorgeous store.",
      "We had brunch here after our magical birthday dinner at cut lounge the night before. I had the salmon Benedict and my darling husband had the huevos rancheros burrito. Of course the mimosas and bloody Mary\u2019s were flowing lol and our waiter at the bar was Pepe who had been there 36 years and was the most attentive and best bartender ever. Needless to say ~ best service ever ~ best room ~ and best brunch ever \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude0d",
      "\u200fExcellent service, and I enjoyed my time there. The cappuccino was great, and the sweet were even better, with wonderfully blended flavors. The total was around $30.\n( The name of the sweet is sunflower )"

      "Going to Boa was an amazing experience. We had the most lovely waiter, Shaw. The caesar salad was made in front of us and was delicious. The steak flight was three different 2 oz pieces of Japanese A5 wagyu. Each were delicious and overall the best steak I ever had. One of the steaks were only made 1 cow at a time and the restaurant needed a special certificate to carry it. The mac and cheese was also amazing and cheesy and buttery. Overall it was an amazing and delicious meal.",
      "Andre, Trinity, Du\u2019a and Jonathan who made and shared the history on how Ceasar\u2019s salads came to be set the bar for restaurants in LA. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Great energy great vibration a wonderful place to celebrate an anniversary or birthday or just to come be made us feel like we bought the place out. WE were served by kind people and that matters when you go out. The staff cares and you feel it at least we did. Thank you to the entire staff for making our anniversary an extra special celebration. If you\u2019re ever in Hollywood go to BOA Steakhouse and tell them The Garrett\u2019s sent you. Ask for Andre and enjoy the rest of your life.\nLove,\nThe Garrett\u2019s",

Robert and Joel, in management displayed excellent consumer touch points, and I highly commend BOA!",

      "Very nice place in Beverly Hills. My girlfriend brought me here to try their signature chicken sandwich that was very good but even if it\u2019s signature I would melt the cheese..no way that you put cold cheese in a sandwich. Fries were very good and the margaritas were amazing!\nIf you are not a big eater share the sandwich because it\u2019s huge!\nConsidering the location they should take care the ventilation system because it\u2019s not nice going out smelling by food so much.\nOverall great typical place that I recommend to everyone in the area",
      "The Honor Bar is very famous around Los Angeles, especially on social media. It\u2019s in a beautiful part of town, Beverly Hills, and it\u2019s designed really well on the inside. It\u2019s dark, but lit enough so you can read the menu but not see every single detail around you. I\u2019m a huge fan of mood lighting, so was a big fan immediately when I walked in. Similar to a darker East Coast steakhouse. Directly next-door to South Beverly Grill, they both share a parking lot and offer valet for $20, but we were able to find street parking a block away, even though it was metered. As the name implies it is a bar, however, they also have table seating, and not only do they have great drinks, but they are known for their great food, especially their crispy chicken sandwich. We made last-minute reservations the morning of the day we wanted to stop in and we were able to be seated right when we arrived for a 7 PM Wednesday night dinner. The hostess was very polite and we were seated at one of the high top tables immediately after entering. It was pretty crowded on the inside, but not too loud. They also have another location in Montecito, which I plan to try next time I am up there.\n\nHonor bar is especially known for their Dings Crispy Chicken Sandwich so we had to order one. It\u2019s a very large portion, so would be easy for two people to split it. I thought it was truly fantastic and worth its reputation. I think it would be even better if there was an avocado smash included but still I enjoyed it very much. They\u2019re also well known for their burger which I plan to try next time. We ordered the Kale Salad to start and it was good although nothing out of the ordinary so I would recommend skipping that. They also have a very large sushi menu, which is a great option. We split the Rainbow Roll and it was great. The seafood was very fresh and everything was prepared perfectly.\n\nOverall pricing is pretty fair, especially given where it\u2019s located. The food and drink quality is great and the service is super fast. I can definitely see why it has the reputation it does and I plan to be back in the future.",
      "Tried their burgers and crispy\nThe burger was flavored with Barbecue spices the thing that we didn\u2019t like\nAs to the crispy chicken it was good\nService was good",
      "Great vibe. Delicious burgers (honor, chicken > carnitas). High quality fresh baked bun. Good portion size. Tabbouleh salad is \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve been coming here for over 5 years and the quality is still the same. The best burger in town, easily. Perfect intimate date spot too. The fries are a must, we usually order 2.\n\nThe Thai Crunch Roll is a heavenly combination that I\u2019ve never experienced before. Recommend highly",
      "Great place.  Went because of the reviews of the chicken sando and burger\u2026\u2026so I got one of each.  They were both delicious, but the winner is\u2026\u2026\u2026the crispy chicken sandwich.   It was really good and not over hyped.  Also had a Negroni that delicious.  The bartender/waiter was awesome.  Cool place."

      "Service was ok nothing special but nothing bad as well.\n\nThe inside is just a typical restaurant, nothing special.\n\nI had a burger which was very good.\n\nHowever my husband had a pork steak with spinach on the side.\nHe got food poisoning and fell extremely unwell the moment I got back home. It must have been the spinach because I we shared everything else and I didn\u2019t have any problems at all. Probably the spinach/ salad was not washed properly. Overall below average experience!\nThe waiters were polite and friendly though.",
      "First of all, the best part about our experience today was our server, Lindsay, and that's saying a lot because our food was delicious, too!\n\nLindsay is a pro. I was a server for years so am naturally more sensitive to good and bad service. Lindsay is one of the best servers I've ever experienced. She's so welcoming and warm, she's knowledgeable about the menu and proactive about helping you choose the right dish, and she's attentive throughout the meal. She has a great attitude and best of all--she's clearly just being herself! What a gem.\n\nI always love the Granville Salad. It's consistently well seasoned and perfectly dressed.\n\nI also had vanilla ice cream and it was INCREDIBLE!\n\nWe'll be back soon and obviously requesting Lindsay.",
      "Ideally, I'd give it a 3.5/5.\n\nGranville in West Hollywood offers a beautiful dining experience. The indoor space is bright and airy, with skylights and plenty of plants creating a cheerful atmosphere. There's a central bar that adds a touch of energy, and the option for outdoor seating is a plus.\n\nUnfortunately, the service wasn't quite up to par with the ambiance. Our server seemed a little frustrated and even rolled her eyes when we asked questions about the menu.  Having both breakfast and brunch menus to navigate was a bit overwhelming, so some clarification would have been helpful.\n\nThe good news is that the food arrived quickly. We tried the village scramble, skirt steak and eggs, french toast, chai latte, and berry lemonade. The lemonade was a miss - way too sour and unbalanced. The chai latte was just okay.\n\nOn a brighter note, both the village scramble and skirt steak came with delicious roasted potatoes (both sweet and regular), which were perfectly cooked. The sausage in the scramble had a nice kick, and the skirt steak was cooked to a perfect medium, though the portion size was a bit on the small side.\n\nThe french toast was decent, but nothing special. The butter that came with it was good.\n\nOverall, Granville has a lovely atmosphere and some good food options. However, the service needs some improvement, and a couple of dishes fell short.",
      "The food is so tasty. We will definitely be returning. The server and other staff were very friendly and helpful. Loved the vibe of the restaurant and the portion sizes of each dish was very good. We left satisfied and had a little left over. I would recommend to everyone to try this place at least once!",
      "We decided to Eat before heading to the Hollywood Bowl concert( first time we usually take food) I used YELP to search for in b/t home & shuttle YELP hasn't failed me yet! Lol! What a Fantastic dining experience! First the Outsofe is Very Cute & Contemporary! The decor inside also has a Cool Vibe. There is seating outside & the inside is larger than I expected. The Hostess was great and we were seated quickly( had reservation since it was a TSunday around 5)\nOur Server was Fantastic! She was attentive, Friendly , & Helpful with our choices. From the reviews we shared the Trio of tacos( Jackfruit, steak & shrimp) Perfect shareable appetizer! Delicious!\nHubby loves a good burger & this didn't disappoint! It was juicy& good Bun! The fries were jist crispy enough! My Porkchop ( one if my favorite meals to order at a new restaurant) was cooked to perfection! I was pleasantly full. With that said OFCOURSE THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSERT! So, brueleed banana brownie!! YUMM! OH..and the Drinks were Excellent! Very Good Dining Experiencel"

We sat on inside by the outside open window area. The soup was a really big bowl, shredded chicken, flavorful and hearty! The chicken taco was bigger than expected and she enjoyed it!! The Berry margarita fruit wasn\u2019t sweet and was okay, not great. Our table did not have place seatings & after food delivered my wife went to another table to get napkins. The server was friendly. The kitchen was on the side of dining room behind glass panels we thought was interesting. The restrooms were upstairs and not ADA friendly that we saw other alternatives.",

One of the few Mexican spots\n\nTacos were good but they\u2019re not your classic \u2018LA tacos\u2019. But the fish taco held its own\n\nThe sopa de tortilla was surprisingly decadent. Huge bowl of crispy tortilla crisps, avocado and firm cheese.. server pours piping hot sopa right on at the table. Delicious!\n\nService was outstanding",

      "The vibes & staff of Cantina Frida are great. Fast and friendly service, solid location in Beverly Hills & can be good for celebrations or date nights.\n\nFood is basic for Mexican/Tex Mex - we ordered quite a few dishes and all were average. Food is above average priced and drink prices are standard for LA ($15-20 per drink). Drinks are strong so that\u2019s a plus. Restaurant can get very loud/hard to hear the people at your own table.\n\nWould give a 4 on the vibes, decor, service, and drinks. Food is a 2-3."

      "Beautiful spot!\n\nI love restaurants that not only have tasty food but also feature beautiful decor + plating. I also appreciate it when chefs & servers go through the details of the dishes you order. Makes you understand + enjoy the food even more. Great spot if you're looking for pretty views & good food.",
      "The people on here complaining and giving one star, don\u2019t exist. There is no way that if you appreciate great food and service that you would be dissatisfied. The place is really pricey as a Michelin restaurant would be in the arguably the most expensive street in the world, with a luxurious brand and tier to the chef of the number one restaurant in the world. Speaking of which, I had the tortellini and the Emilia Burger as they are the two Massimo classics in the menu.. bread basket and dessert were amazing as was the service. The burger was delicious and the tortellini was elegant and had a big flavour. I don\u2019t think I would have to go back again but I certainly enjoyed my visit."

He only explained about $60 free flow so I assumed it was $18 for a glass because Champagne on the menu was $18.\n\nHowever they charged $40 for a glass of Champagne. I asked the waiter why it was $40 not $18. He just answered it was $40 without no further explanation.\n\nAs a tourist, I definitely feel like got ripped off.

      "A lovely evening of fine, fresh, dining on fascinating recipes by an obviously caring chef.  Service is not to be mistaken as poor but what a traditional dining experience should be: un-rushed, uninterrupted evenings with friends infused by light, occasional inquiries as well as presentation of each dish.  The setting is tasteful, a small mix of art and interior design with most comfortable and intimate seating which does not scream out \u201cdress code please\u201d but is most certainly enhanced by harkening your dress code back to a time when meals out were occasions to dress and \u201cshow\u201d up.  Do not be intimidated by a French menu or the seemingly inaccessible.

What is a thanksgiving dinner without cornbread. What\u2019s worse is everyone received theirs but me. It was 7pm. Middle of dinner service. And they run out?? Makes no sense then the manager says I\u2019ll give you 20% off your meal. As if I needed the discount. I want there to pay 250+ for dinner per person and you think I worried about a discount. What a joke. What\u2019s worse the. Rolls they brought me weren\u2019t even really good outstanding. I left the restaurant. Don\u2019t need a condescending restaurant manager who can\u2019t control his kitchen. How can I trust the food when they can\u2019t even do the basics.  175.00 for thanksgiving dinner plus drinks. Wine and tip. Your way over 250.00. What a major disappointment will never go back to restaurant or hotel ever again.",
      "We were greeted promptly, the manager was excellent.  I am giving this restaurant 4-star instead of 5 because we had a waiter with an attitude.  It took him a while to serve us, additionally, we were relocated to a different table.  I was surprised to see that he wanted to serve me coffee that had been on my previous table for over 10 minutes.  When I asked him to bring a fresh cup of coffee, he wasn't happy about it.\n\nNevertheless, he was replaced with a waitress called Ruby.  She was excellent, very friendly, approachable, and great customer service.  Food and ambiance are far below average for a hotel of this caliber. With a few improvements to the menu, food quality, and environment, this could be a great spot!"

      "We dined at Spice Affair in Los Angeles with a party of four, hoping for an exceptional Indian cuisine experience. Unfortunately, the visit was a mixed bag.\nWe started with the Dahi Kabab, which was underwhelming and lacked the expected flavor and creaminess. For the main course, we had Dal Makhani and Karahi Paneer. The Dal Makhani was just average, neither disappointing nor impressive. The Karahi Paneer fared better, offering balanced flavors and well-cooked paneer, making it a decent choice.\nThe meal's highlight was the Gulab Jamun, which was deliciously sweet and spongy, providing a satisfying end to our dinner. However, the overall food quality did not justify the high prices. The restaurant is a bit overpriced for what it offers, especially considering the average quality of most dishes.\nThe ambience at Spice Affair is good, with a touch of elegance that makes for a pleasant dining environment. However, it falls short of being truly up-market. Despite the mediocre food, the staff were excellent\u2014prompt, polite, and attentive, enhancing our dining experience.\nIn summary, the place offers a pleasant atmosphere and great service, but the food quality and high prices are disappointing. If you do visit, the Gulab Jamun is worth trying, but overall, the experience may not meet the expectations set by the pricing.",
      "Spice Affair has set a new standard for Indian food in LA. I tried several dishes and they were all exceptional and delicious (my favorite was the butter chicken and lamb). The atmosphere is beautiful and comfortable, with attentive, knowledgeable and gracious service. I look forward to returning again soon!",
      "Butter chicken IS TO DIE FOR, I haven\u2019t had any better. We also got the saag paneer, two appetizers, garlic naan, and lamb vindaloo. The service was amazing!! They make sure you love your food and give awesome recommendations. This is my favorite Indian place so far!! We will definitely be coming back!",
      "I have to give this restaurant 5 stars. It is a beautiful decorated with wonderful food and impeccable service......If you want the perfect spot for date night....this is the place.",
      "Great Indian food. We have been there a few times and each time has the same great taste."

      "This was such a fantastic meal and service! First of all, hats off to our waitress Sonya and beverage/wine manager Alfredo for their exemplary in-depth and friendly service, knowledge, and passion for their food and wine!\n\nAs for the food, this was quite a Italian culinary adventure. The food at Culina was some of the tastiest and unique Italian cuisine I've had in Los Angeles.\n\nFor appetizer we had the Focaccia Al Rosmarino, Carciofi Fritti (Fried Artichoke), and Polpette Al Sugo (Wagyu meatballs).\n\nThe Focaccia was a delicious way to start with its Tris di Salse ('nduja Calabrese, tomato-basil chutney, and sundried tomato tapenade). There's a lot going on here with each \"salsa\" that gives variety in a delicious way.\n\nThe Polpette Al Sugo (Wagyu meatballs) is very savory can easily be a centerpiece of a delicious pasta by itself.\n\nUnfortunately I had the Carciofi Fritti as my last appetizer and of the three it was the most ordinary. It's not that bad, it's just not as remarkable after having the other two delicious appetizers.\n\nAs for the main course, I've had the pasta Crested di Gallo e Salsiccia, and it was one of the best pastas I've had. A lot of flavor that are distinct and works very well together. The sauce is white wine that is light. Each ingredient (fennel sausage, broccolini, mollica di pane, Calabrian chili, and parmesan) works like individual instruments in a symphony. The fennel sausage is the meaty base of the flavor, the  broccolini adds the herbal flavor, the mollica di pane or bread crumbs adds crunchy texture, the calabrian chili adds a hint of spiciness and excitement, and the parmesan tops it off with its cheesy salty goodness.\n\nThe wine paired was Lato Sud, a red wine with an unforgettable delicious taste that starts a little bit smoky and spicy and ends in a slightly sweet and mellow after taste. Each sip is a delightful surprise.\n\nFinally for dessert, we had Tiramisu and Cannolo al Tavolo (fried cannoli). The Tiramisu had the most consistent texture and consistency I've had with Tiramisu with its thick but light mascarpone mousse that makes you want to close your eyes and savor each bite, while the cannoli was a tasty crunchy dessert that is both playful and a real delight to eat.\n\nLong story short, everything except the fried artichoke was delicious and highly recommended. Compliments to the chefs and the staff, this was a five-star dinner!",
      "Flavorful rendition of coastal Italian with extremely friendly and attentive staff at dinner and nice arbor seating.  Seasonal menu but the staples are done very well",
      "Stayed at the Four Seasons and tried their restaurant, Culina, out. Top notch service that you'd expect at the Four Seasons, with extensive wine knowledge by our dinner servers, Joe and Kristoff, and the dedicated support staff. The menu offerings and recommendations were delicious for both breakfast and dinner.\n\nThe decor is top notch, and the space offerings your choice of ambience are tastefully defined. Indoor dining room was bold and spacious. The al fresco options elevate the experience. Lush, tranquil, and inviting.\n\nIsadore Sharp would be proud of this establishment. Totally recommend!",
      "I went for a work dinner. Excellent service. Fabulous food. I want to give a shout out to our lead server, Sonya. She really took care of our table. When I asked about amaro, she was able to provide an explanation of the flavor profiles and then provided me a tasting flight of 3 amari so I could appreciate the differences.",
      "I had a great dinner here and thought it was amazing. The ambiance is very beautiful and service is excellent. The menu also has some items that can be made vegan, I tried the tomato soup from the in-room dining menu. Menu, I tried the focaccia, and they made me a pasta. That was excellent. The sun's there by the glass is to die for."

They apologized mentioning that our order was at the end of the list but we noticed that other people that arrived after us were being served before us.\n\nNot sure what happened but I must admit that my burger was very delicious.",

The specials lent themselves to my appetite and were exquisitely great recommendations from the staff. I highly recommend this place for their quality of food, but they also have a great selection of drinks & wine, as well as catering service. Cheers!",
      "Our Favorite Restaurant! Love Chef Isaac & His Wife Manager Chancey!\nThe rest of the staff are equally Friendly & Helpful! We & everyone are always treated like Family!\nVery Nice contemporary Decor! We enjoy the creative Menu!\nThe Ceviche, Grilled Pork chops, burgers, steak, & Truffle fries are my faves! Go!",
      "Went here for Dine LA last night and was excited because it was my first Dine LA experience. My gf said last time she was here the food was great and it was worth coming back to for Dine LA. We had reservations and we were seated upon arrival. Everything was great so far, our waiter was very nice. Found it odd they were out of the duck confit, in the first hour of dinner service.\nDrinks:\n\nChef special cocktail (bourbon and absinthe mix) it was ok\nBanshee Pinot Noir (a bit fruity, slightly dry, and smooth)\n\nFor appetizers we ordered:\nGrilled Spanish Octopus (pretty tasty would recommend)\nChile con Queso Truffle Mac (also another tasty option, truffle oil was very light)\nRoasted Butternut Squash Soup (great soup, loved how the pepper and spices cut the natural sweetness of the butternut squash a bit)\n\nEntree:\nWild Pacific Shrimp ala Plancha (tasted good but was Abit salty)\n14oz Angus Ribeye Steak Frites (steak was tasty and fries were nice and crispy. I've had better steaks but this wasn't bad)\n\nDessert:\nChocolate Ganache Tart (yummy)\n\nReason for 2 stars:\n\nAppetizers  took quite a while to come out, 35-40mins. Entrees took about an hour to come out. Our ribeye was sent to a different table and had to cook another one. The shrimp came out but was missing a portion of the entree (crispy paella rice which imo was integral for giving contrast in texture) we had to ask our waiter why it was missing a part of the entree. Food overall was good, but waiting for about 40mins minutes for appetizers and a little over an hour for our entrees sucked to the point I wasn't even hungry or had the appetite to even eat half my entree. Our waiter comped our drinks which was a nice gesture, but most likely will not return.\n\nNote: no picture of rib eye steak frites because I was IDGAF at that point to almost not care anymore.",
      "I genuinely loved this cute spot \ud83d\udc9e found it at random and I got their lunch special ! 1. Soup of the day 2. Salad 3. Pick your entree and 4. Drink  for $25. Our server Chanci (I don't know how to spell her name) was so funny and attentive! I will definitely come back for Happy hour !"

      "Tucked in the Avalone hotel in a quiet residential neighborhood. The waiter elevated the experience by 100%. He was full of joy and super attentive. Dining options inside or outside around the pool\u2026well edited menu, finished with the warm cookies- dessert was the best.",
      "The ambiance is nice, not too loud and not too crowded. Food is decent, but i was expecting more for a place like this. Cocktails weren't really up to par with the environment as well. If you're not looking for fancy fancy but just a nice place to have a bite, that might check the boxes.",
      "Dined here while staying at the Avalon Beverly Hills - arrived late and did not want to go looking around for dinner. Service was good, ate outdoor next to the pool and heater was on. Had the clams linguine which was fine but portion was small and it was pricey. Very nice ambiance."

      "From the moment we walked in the service was a notch above the rest. They were brightening my day, one joke at a time. I ordered the Blasteran Burger and was slightly disappointed. It was $27 and about a 6/10. The fries on the other hand were something to write home about! The garlic parmesan fries were likely the best fries I've ever tasted. My mother ordered the fish plate and said it was \"tasty\". We ordered the French Toast for dessert it was very soft and very good. I would definitely recommend it!",
      "The food was fantastic!  The Blasteran Burger with Truffle Fries:  both were cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  The Garlic Noodles with added shrimp were super good.  The shrimp were butterflied and grilled perfectly.  So much flavor.  To top it all off, the staff was super friendly and attentive.\n\nThis was my second visit.  The first time around I had the Pork Belly Bao which were amazing!",
      "Deliciously prepared plant-based burger, likely one of the best I\u2019ve enjoyed in LA. The bun to burger ratio was on point. The herbivore was filled with avocado, red onions, lettuce, tomato , vegan cheese, arugula, and cashew remoulade. Mouth-watering goodness. The mixed green salad had crispy lettuce, cherry tomatoes, finely shredded carrots, and a bright refreshing dressing. The only reason I didn\u2019t give this five stars is due to the price of the burger ($28 for the burger only). Adding the mixed green salad was an additional $5. Had I chosen fries it would have been an additional $7+. Food was delicious no doubt, but pricey for a burger. Nice atmosphere and friendly servers. Metered parking available, no valet.",
      "I personally feel like the best wagyu burgers in town are here at Blasteran. Been coming here for years to get my burger fix and their wagyu burgers always live up to my cravings. The truffle mac and cheese is also delicious but on the heavier side. These are pricier so I like to come here for special occasions. Street parking in a popular area. Garlic parm fries are also a delicious side but I like the burgers best.",
      "Wow! I can't even begin to describe how amazing that meal was! It was absolutely incredible! The flavors were out of this world! The tomato soup and steak sandwich together created a burst of flavors that I will never forget. Honestly, it was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life!"

It was bland and was definitely missing something.\nIf you looking for a place with a nice vibe this is it but the food isn't that great.",

More than anything, SPAGHETTI NATALE was amazing. It was so simple but packed with flavors and spaghetti was cooked perfectly. It was on the expensive side since the fish was $58, but pasta prices are not like that and I think I will go back a lot more for that pasta alone. It is definitely a classic old school italian place with great service.",

      "When I and my party arrived we were seated promptly and given menus + water in short order. We ordered within 10-15 minutes of being seated, but had to order both our appetizer and entrees in one go. The service was pretty fast and the wait staff seemed to be in good spirits. We received our entree which was a margherita pizza (which I unfortunately didn\u2019t take a picture of) and it was pretty good a solid 3/5 in the flavor department. As for the entrees:\n\nChicken and mashed potato with lemon and capers:\nThis actually tasted quite nice, but the piece of chicken and overall portion was so small for a dish of that price. 4/5\n\nLasagna:\nThe lasagna came out piping hot and was promptly devoured because it tasted so good! A bit heavy on the salt, but no complaints beyond that! 5/5\n\nBolognese:\nReally good portion size, bolognese sauce was full of flavor! 5/5\n\nRisotto al funghi:\nProbably the largest portion size of any item my party ordered, but this had no flavor. It\u2019s as if the salt and seasonings were used on all the previous dishes and nothing was leftover for this. 1/5\n\nThe food overall was really good, the service fast, and despite the prices being so expensive we ended up paying less than $200 for our 4 entrees and pizza. Thanks for the meal!",
      "Ok these pics didn't do it justice cuz we're all hangry and had 0 patience\n\ncozy Italian place to dine in and we're happy to find some place like this in BH. Super satisfied with the food, staffs, and romantic ambience!",
      "Looove this place! The food was delicious (delizioso!) and we really enjoyed the breeze and atmosphere on the back patio at the historic hotel. Our server, Simone, was absolutely amazing.",

The dishes are the perfect mix of inventive, creative art, texture, and taste. The wine pairing was exquisite, and this is still some of the best service I've ever had, including higher-rated Michelin star restaurants. Have you ever left a restaurant and wondered when you're going to experience something like that again? This is the place, and the answer (so far) is no. Why do I still think about garlic leek soup? Because of this meal.",

The pigeon was to die for and the abalone was the best abalone I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of eating.\n\nFor dessert you go to a different room which had a very different ambience.\n\nLoved the creativity of all the different foods.

      "Cute little underrated authentic Italian sandwich shop. Pricey for a sandwich until you take a bite- and it becomes worth it. Very delicious and high quality, highly recommend.",
      "I would like to think I'm a bit of a sandwich connoisseur so I'm always on the hunt for the best of the best. I decided to try lorenzo out after a friend of mine said it was the best sandwich she's had in Cali.\n\nI ordered the Cotto.  The first thing I noticed when biting into this sandwich was strange sensation like there was wax paper attached to the bread. It was very odd and I didn't get used to it until the sandwich was half done.  So I can't say I was a fan of the bread. However the inside was delicious. Perhaps a little too much brie.  Because it was so heavy on the cheese the sandwich was very filling and could have easily been two meals.\n\nI'm going to give this place another chance as I want to try one of their other sandwiches now.  Maybe the bakery that bakes their bread just had an off day.\n\nDon't count on eating inside here as there was only three little tables with a couple of seats each cramped into their tiny eating area.  However, a couple were available when I was ordering my food to go.  It took about 10 minutes for them to fulfill my order after ordering it.",
      "Tasty Italian sandwiches in Beverly Hills. The owners are from Florence and you can tell it has some similarities to the famous sandwich shop there. The bread is very rustic, crunchy exterior and soft and airy interior. Meats and other ingredients are also really fresh. We got the Lorenzo and the Capriccio which were both delicious. The lemon mousse also was fresh and not too sweet.\n\nLimited seating but easy to take on the go. The prices are on the higher end but honestly, not as bad as I thought and appropriate for what you are getting."

      "I had the pleasure of dining at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills Hotel recently, and it was an absolutely delightful experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was elegant and inviting, creating a perfect setting for a memorable meal.\n\nThe food at the Polo Lounge exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Benedict egg with salmon, and it was cooked to perfection. The combination of the creamy hollandaise sauce and the flavorful salmon was simply divine. Also,  blueberries lemon pancakes, which were a delightful burst of sweet and tangy flavors. Each bite was a true delight for the taste buds.\n\nI would also like to extend a special thanks to Salvador, our waiter at the Polo Lounge. He provided exceptional service throughout our meal, going above and beyond to ensure that we had a wonderful dining experience. His attentiveness, knowledge, and friendly demeanor truly made us feel welcome and well taken care of.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills Hotel was nothing short of exceptional. The delicious food, elegant ambiance, and outstanding service provided by Salvador made it a truly memorable dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience in Beverly Hills.",
      "Polo Lounge in the renowned Beverly Hills hotel was our destination for Father's Day with my wife and friends. Our favorite waitress, Michelle, who we know from a popular jazz location in the area, invited us to this tropical haven. We were seated outside in a booth often reserved for celebrities, surrounded by lush greenery and warm smiles. The live music was nice and inviting. The food was exceptional, particularly the tender steak and delicious scrambled eggs. Wifey enjoyed the chicken and waffle, complimenting the juicy chicken. Our drinks, lemon drops, whiskey sour, and espresso martinis were also impressive.  Chef Joshua and his team provided attentive and accommodating service, making our experience truly memorable. Thank you, Polo Lounge, for a phenomenal experience.",
      "A surreal experience to say the least. This iconic venue has been featured in so many movies I\u2019ve seen growing up. Truly a pleasure and it lived up to the expectations. The service was impeccable. The aesthetic pleasure was unmatched. We had breakfast right after flying into LA, first stop. The fresh orange juice was wonderful. Eggs, hash browns, bacon and the bread were amazing. It\u2019s relatively well priced given the history of this place. I will be returning many times again and recommend you try as well! They also are very accommodating, I had set a reservation for 10:15am and because of the marathon going on at that time I was going to arrive late. When I called to let them know, they were very understanding.",
      "The only thing you\u2019ll definitely enjoy and it\u2019s a must is bread basket \ud83e\udd56\n\nThe menu offered a delightful array of American classics with a modern twist, and each dish was a culinary masterpiece. The ambiance, with its soft lighting and live piano, created an intimate atmosphere that made the evening truly special. It\u2019s no wonder this place is a favorite among celebrities; dining here made me feel like one too. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nThe service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring every detail was perfect.",
      "My favorite breakfast spot in Beverly Hills! This restaurant consistently delivers incredible, flavorful food. I absolutely love it and definitely recommend making a reservation to experience breakfast at the Polo Lounge."

      "We ordered the Matu set for 2 (in my opinion is the winner of the sets) and every single dish that came out was amazing. All the meats were cooked perfectly pink in the center and even the braised beef cheek melts in your mouth.\n\nSide dishes of bone tallow fries and creamed spinach wow. Fries were crispy and tasty - wish it was a bigger portion. Creamed spinach was so rich in cheese that you can barely taste the spinach.\n\nThe ambience is a little too dark, which I get for a cozy feeling but the sound proofing can be better cos it\u2019s hard to have a conversation.",
      "We brought our own wine, corking fee $40. Had a great experience here but they took my wine into the back and put it into the decanter, as it is a bottle we brought, would have preferred if they had poured it in front of us. Otherwise it was a great meal and food was delicious. We did the matu dinner which is a 5 course meal and definitely worth it especially if you\u2019re a first timer. Highly recommend. Great atmosphere and everyone who we interacted with was very nice!",
      "Went here for a solo birthday dinner. This was some of the best food i have ever had! Had the 3 course menu, everything was so delicious, and the service and ambiance were phenomenal. If you want to treat yourself to a wonderful and intimate dinner with friends or loved ones, would very much recommend. and all their meat is halal! Very hard to find luxury and fine dining like this with halal meat, very thankful!",
      "what a sandwich! probably the best steak and cheese sandwich i've ever had. they use the highest quality vagyu beef, and comes in a bu  that is sessame seed covered. i opted in for the hot green pepper and it made all the difference. amazing sandwich comes with potatoe crisps that were fried in wagyu fat. simply delicious",
      "Matu was an excellent choice to have our steak dinner! Their grass fed NZ Wagyu was simply delicious and outstanding.\n\nTried out the 24 hour bone broth\nHand cut steak tarts Japanese accent\nMiatke mushrooms\nRib eye  steak cooked on wood\nNY steak cooked on wood\nPomme puree\n\nVery chic and romantic Resturant loved the vibe and its bar.\n\nFood was outstanding\n\nDefinitely a must visit for steak"

      "Absolutely amazing, show stopping, incredible. The name is perfectly fitting with all the leopard print and velvet decor. This is surely my new favorite restaurant in Beverly Hills. The wait staff seem like they majored in the service industry. If you want to impress out of towners, your parents, a date, or just want to be surrounded by people straight out of magazines this is the place.\nThe food not to mention is divine and worth every penny. Especially the tuna tartare, the pastas, and the spumoni. The cocktails were perfect too.",
      "The EDDC kicked off 2024 at La Dolce Vita in Beverly Hills.  Not a very large space but the three of us fit comfortably at a small table/booth.  Ambiance was a little dark for our late night repast but well attended by a diverse and talented crowd.\n\nWe started things off with a negroni, chocolate martini, and a 50-50 martini along with the mozzarella di buffala and the shrimp fra diabola.  The blue prawns were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of heat from the calabrian chili.  Drinks were sturdy and the 50-50 side car was a nice touch.\n\nA caesar salad prepared table side was next followed by main dishes including spaghetti and meatballs along with the bone-in veal parmesana.  The veal was delectable and overshadowed the spaghetti despite the later being impressive in it's own right.  We ended the night with a neopolitan style dessert balanced between pistachio, chocolate and cherry gelato.\n\nOverall, a solid start to 2024 and an enjoyable night out at an aspirant for top Italian restaurant of the year.",
      "I have known about La Dolce Vita for quite some time given that it was a former frequent stop for Frank Sinatra and many other Golden Age of Hollywood celebrities. I work very close to the unassuming building so I have been driving by it for many months but finally got the opportunity on Saturday to stop in for dinner. As mentioned the restaurant is very unassuming from the outside, I didn\u2019t even know it was a restaurant until I paid attention to the small sign out front. Inside is a different story though, it has old world charm and is filled with dark red booths, low lighting, and is complete with a classic East Coast style bar in the front corner. Our server and the rest of the staff we encountered were very polite and all of our items arrived quickly from the kitchen. They don\u2019t have a dedicated parking lot, however street parking is easy to find in this part of Beverly Hills or at worst there are a few expensive parking garages close by as well.\n\nAll of our dishes were fantastic. We started off with the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, which is prawns cooked in a delicious marinara, and the Clams Oreganata, which are Littleneck clams baked with bread crumbs on top. The clams were warm and tasty and although not many in number, the flavors were truly great.  For our entrees we chose the Branzino Piccata, this was my favorite dish of the night mainly because of the piccata sauce and how well the fish was cooked, and the Lemon Bucatini, which was light and packed with lemon flavor. It was a great summer dish.\n\nOverall a wonderful classic Italian dinner in a beautiful part of town. We both had a great experience and would recommend to anyone for any occasion although it would be especially a great call for a date or business dinner location.",
      "We were warmly greeted by Nicole and an old friend Ashley when my wife and I first walked in acknowledging that it was my sweetheart\u2019s birthday. This was  our very FIRST visit to this restaurant.  It was however all down hill from there. Bread was brought to the table and unfortunately the busboy knocked over the table lamp which crashed and broke my water glass saturating the entire table in front of me. Accidents do happen but instead of changing the table cloth they put two napkins over the saturated area which remained soaked throughout dinner. The table side Caesar salad was delicious. When my wife\u2019s pasta dish came to the table I had to wait 10 minutes for my entree (a $96 bone in veal chop parmigiana) to come. The server we had was very nice and had warned me of how big the veal dish was. He said I would have another dinner tomorrow. He was right.  The veal was excellent and I ate only half. We asked to take home the leftover pasta and veal. A doggy bag was brought to our table before dessert. When the dessert was delivered I truly thought at least a candle would accompany the chocolate tart to celebrate my wife\u2019s birthday(acknowledging the event when we checked in)but sadly it was not the case. We paid the bill and left somewhat disappointed. What then made the entire situation even worse is when walking to the car I realized that the half of my veal dish was missing from the bag. I quickly went back and after searching was told it was probably given to someone else. (Nice surprise) The manager offered to \u201cfire up\u201d another one while I wait but I declined to wait around. He then said he would make a note in the system so that on the next visit I would get the replacement. Based on the evening\u2019s experience I am truly not sure there will be a next time.",
      "Happy to return to this institution especially now with the new management. Food is beyond amazing and the service is excellent. It felt amazing to see this place alive and well. Food was tasty and I highly recommend the table side Cesar salad and the meatball spaghetti! Will absolutely return!"

      "Lawry's Prime Rib is a classic Los Angeles steakhouse that delivers a memorable dining experience, and I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here tonight.\n\nThe star of the show is, of course, the prime rib \u2013 carved tableside and cooked to perfection. But don't miss out on the decadent mashed potatoes, the addictive Yorkshire pudding, and the delicious croutons!\n\nThe service is top-notch, and my servers Dea and Jorge were some of the best I've ever encountered \u2013 funny, friendly, and always attentive. Overall, Lawry's is a great choice for a special occasion or a night out to enjoy some iconic LA fare.",
      "They forgot our cocktails twice. The server wasn\u2019t really interested in our table it felt like. The fish cakes were delicious, we really recommend those. But the meat was far below what we are used to. I am used to more French and Dutch steak and this wasn\u2019t super good. It was really below average. The scallops were delicious though. It was really amazing.",
      "It was good. I would go back. I would recommend getting the Lawry's cut or lower and adding on more sides or appetizers.  The Brady cut had a big bone and a lot of fat. Which in all seem like a smaller cut choice.  Still happy.",
      "I wanted to treat myself for my birthday to the California $60 prime rib. I had it delivered and was horribly disappointed.\nThe cut looked nothing like the photo on their menu! It was paper thin and mostly composed of fat! I removed the fat and took one mouthful of the dry lean part and was ill. I could not keep it down. It tasted horrible. The burned Yorkshire pudding and completely stale bread did not help as they were inedible.\nI used to love Lawry\u2019s, I\u2019m out $95 without having been able to eat a thing. Never again!",
      "Service is super interactive & phenomenal. they make the salad in front of you, cut the rib in front of you.\n\nThere\u2019s valet parking on site, which was only $11~ and limited street parking. Please reserve in advance to avoid any inconvenience! Went on a weekday and they had a full house.\n\nPrime rib was flavorful and melted into your mouth. The mashed potatoes and corn paired perfectly with the steak.\n\nEven if you prefer steak cooked traditionally on the grill, this spot is a great intro for prime rib!"

      "Reviewing restaurants and food can be a challenging task, as opinions can vary greatly and personal experiences play a significant role. Upon arrival at the restaurant, one is immediately struck by the beauty of the hotel, with its elegant chandeliers and inviting atmosphere. The valet service, while attentive, may come across as overly eager to park cars in prime spots, which may not always be necessary. Upon leaving, I handed $100 bill with my ticket and the polite gentleman thanked me and walked away. I did not ask for my car to be taken care of or parked in front. I wanted my change but none was given. So much for a Porsche!\n\nThe restaurant itself is tastefully decorated but may be considered plain by some. The food, however, is exceptional, though the prices may not be suitable for everyone. A basic dinner for two resulted in a bill totaling $1000, which may be considered steep compared to other high-end establishments such as BOA Steakhouse or Mastros, where a similar meal may cost $400-$500, including luxurious items like black caviar. For 2 People!\n\nDespite the high prices, the quality of the food and the exceptional service provided by the servers were highlights of the dining experience. However, the cost of items such as a $50-$75 old fashioned cocktail may be seen as excessive when compared to other establishments. It tasted just as bad as Crown Apply Royal on ice which is usually $12-$15 dollars!\n\nWhile the food was enjoyable, the overall experience may not justify the steep prices, leading to a decision not to return in the future.",
      "I heard this restaurant a while, finally we made it, it was my family dinner, also celebrated my husband, me and my daughter\u2019s birthday together, because we wouldn\u2019t meet on mine and my daughter\u2019s birthday this summer, so we decided having a fine dinner for three of us. We had prime filet mignon, Australia waygu filet mignon and New York strip, started with butter lettuce salad and tuna tartar, side order were truffle fries and creamed spinach, every dish was amazing, especially tuna tartar, it\u2019s memorable taste!! I finished my dish which is rare to me. After ordering our dessert, our server delivered three sweet dishes with candles, that was really touching and surprising! My husband loved the banana cream pie, he said it\u2019s the best one he ever had \ud83d\ude01 The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was very satisfying, and a dish with five different sweets was neat like jewelry. We went across street of Rodeo drive for a walk after finishing dinner. It was a super great experience for us, thank you !",
      "I need more stars for this restaurant!!!! We had reservations at Cut for my husbands birthday celebration. But as usual, we prefer bar/lounge to eat\u2026.so always keep that in mind regarding my reviews. So instead of going to the restaurant, we went to Cut Lounge. Cut Lounge has the same menu as well as a bar menu. Both rooms in the restaurant and the lounge are beautiful. However, the restaurant seems a little bit more sterile and not as warm as the Lounge. The photos here are of the lounge.\nRegarding the food, which is the same for both places\u2026 I literally need to go back and give my other reviews of steakhouses one less star because there was nothing better than what I ate at cut. My steak was literally the best steak in the universe. I had the Australian Stone ax Wagyu, 6oz filet which was literally the best steak I\u2019ve ever tasted in my life. Every single thing we ate was beyond five stars. I cannot explain how delicious this meal was. It was definitely pricey, but well worth it !!! if you want to have mouthgasm after mouthgasm go to Cut. In addition, if you end up in cut Lounge, the bartender Jeffrey is stellar. He had such wealth of knowledge about different alcohol\u2026. Different cuts of meat. He was amazing. Overall 10 stars.\nHere\u2019s a little more detail about the side dishes\u2026 The onion rings which are only on the Cut lounge menu are so good and light It\u2019s like eating heaven. The burrata toast was beyond belief. The oysters \ud83d\udc45we ordered two orders because they were so delicious. We had the butter lettuce salad, which was the best salad I\u2019ve ever had in my life\u2026 \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude1cthe carrots \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfffincredible\u2026And the steaks could not be better literally I never thought a steak could be so good. I know I sound redundant, but I\u2019m still amazed.\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d and then to top it all off the desserts were off the chain. I was in a state of heavenly oral fixation bliss after that meal.\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfff",
      "Reason for visiting: brother's birthday\n\nDate/time of visit:\u00a0Friday night, ~7:15 PM\n\nParking:\u00a0valet only; didn't see any parking on the street. Valet is shared with Beverly Wilshire; the entrance is on El Camino and is a bit hard to find so drive slowly if possible. Probably easier to look for entrance to Beverly Wilshire hotel. Valet is $10 with validation at the front; $20 without.\n\nParty size: 5; 3 adults, 2 teens\n\nEnvironment/ambience: busy; restaurant is up the stairs to the left of the Wolfgang Puck picture under the hostess. Reservations are probably required (I did not make reservations myself) and upscale dining. Dress code seems to be casual though. No TVs around. Busy and loud. Pretty cool art around the restaurant.\n\nService: fantastic; came around often and provided suggestions. All servers were great; friendly\n\nFood:\u00a0we shared the 22 oz  Prime Ribeye and Wagyu Porterhouse (medium rare). Also had the truffle fries, Mac 'n' Cheese, Samurai Sword, From The Hearth bread, complimentary bread, Oysters, Baked Alaska and Banana Cream Pie desserts. Everything was great, cooked as requested without mistakes. Only drawback for banana cream pie dessert is it lists creme brulee as well but not really a full portion creme brulee; it's really a taste of creme brulee and not really 2 in 1 dessert. BUT everything tasted great!\n\nCost: $1100 for 5 (including tip); 2 teens\n\nWould I go back (yes/no): 95/5",
      "Loved our dinner at The Cut.  Amazing menu and great staff.  Our server, Mario was outstanding.  My wife had the bone in ribeye and I had the salmon.  Everything was cooked to perfection."

      "We got the spicy tuna & crispy rice, hamachi crudo, avocado hummus, chopped salad, burger, and butter cake. I would go back and order the spicy tuna and avocado hummus again, maybe try something different too.\n\nThe chopped salad didn't have a ton of flavor. The burger was decent, but the bread was a bit soggy. The butter cake had good flavor but was a little hard and too sweet for me to have more than a couple bites.\n\nService was slightly disorganized with multiple people helping out our table and not knowing what we'd already ordered, but they were super friendly and attentive.",

Will try smth else next time)) Food was amazing, with great presentation, lots of flavors.

      "Hosted daughter\u2019s college graduation luncheon at Circa 55 and it was AMAZING!!! I worked w/ Annette to plan all the advance details and she was truly fabulous!!! The day of the event, Sergio, Jeff & team executed and made the event so special and spectacular!   Very highly recommend!!",
      "11/30/2023 The CIRCA 55 is situated inside the Beverly Hilton that was broken ground\u00a0 in 1953 and open to the public\u00a0in 1955. The ambience is excellent. The Golden Globe Awards ceremony was held at the hotel year over year since 1961.\n\nThe Veranda is not perfect. For example,\nIt has been using a wrong cup for cappuccinos that ruined the taste. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed a cup of cappuccinos made by a new specialty coffee machine at one Marriott namesake hotel last night. One glass of Moet & Chanson Imperial Brut Champagne costs $32, plus tax and tip. It is not for most patrons to visit. Also, the appetizer missed a sauce cup. I decided not to ask.",
      "I've been to Circa 55 several times, but yesterday was my first networking event at the location. The staff and catering were lovely. The tray pass servers for the event were so warm, especially Frank.",
      "The highest rating is for the service - thanks to Edwin. Noteworthy are the lamb chops. Those were impeccable! Although my companion never enjoyed anything less than medium, she enjoyed medium to rare chops! Delightful. Beef tartar was ok, the color of the meat was dark due to either some spices or keeping it on ice. I don\u2019t recommend the tartar. Atmosphere is not bad, but nothing special. Come here for food, if you stay at the hotel.",
      "As good as expected in such a storied establishment. Whether sitting outside by the pool or inside, the attention to detail is evident everywhere. Plenty of options in the breakfast buffet but you have to spring for the top tier version to get access to everything. Impossible to complain about the service, one gets pampered here whether one wants it or not."

      "This might be my favorite thai restaurant!\n\nWe ordered the dishes that were recommended to us by our server, which were the sea bass and the crab fried rice.\nBoth were incredible delicious and I can't recommended the 2 enough.",
      "SO good!\n\nI highly recommend the sea bass curry & mango sticky rice. The sea bass curry is lime-y, filling, and one of the best dishes I've had. The mango sticky rice is light and the perfect way to end the night.\n\nEveryone was super nice and it's a cute spot to dine with friends!",
      "* Papaya Salad is fresh and invigorating.\n* Crispy Pork Belly has an amazing contrast between its crispy skin layer and its melting tender meat under the skin.\n* Sea Bass Curry also shares this amazing combination with a rich flavor of curry.",
      "La Ong Thai restaurant in Beverly Hills, great first time trying this place.\nFrom the wonderful ambiance to the food, every dish was a master piece.\nStarting with chicken sate with pickled cucumbers,Tuna steak with peanut chili sauce, crispy pork with watercress, to the green curry with eggplant and Thai basil and noodles on the side.\nThe presentation and the flavors of every dish were excellent.\nThe service was great.\nI would highly recommend this restaurant."

      "I couldn\u2019t be happier when I heard that Novikov finally opened in Beverly Hills. If you know any of the Novikov restaurants, you know that have exceptional customer service and food always taste amazing. They have brunch menu, which you get to pick a starter and the main course. Even tho Novikov is Russian corp, the restaurant is Italian. Also they do have purse chairs which every restaurant in Beverly needs.",
      "I recently visited Novikov and was very impressed. The service was excellent, with friendly and attentive staff. The food was delicious and looked great.\n\nThe cocktail menu had a lot of great options. The best part was the Napoleon dessert, which was a perfect end to the meal.\n\nOverall, Novikov offers a fantastic dining experience with great service, tasty food, and amazing cocktails and desserts. Highly recommended!",
      "Nestled in glamorous Beverly Hills, Novikov Restaurant & Lounge offers a chic and luxurious dining experience with a unique Mediterranean twist. From the moment you walk in, the stylish and cozy ambiance sets the perfect scene, whether it's for a romantic dinner or a lively celebration. The menu is a culinary adventure, with highlights like refreshing New Zealand Salmon Tartare and the indulgent Bluefin Tuna Tartare with Gold Oscietra Caviar. The Tagliatelle Wagyu Bolognese and creamy Risotto with Asparagus and Black Truffle are must-tries. The service is top-notch, with attentive and knowledgeable staff who make great recommendations. Their cocktails and extensive wine list perfectly complement the flavorful dishes, and desserts like Tiramisu and Hazelnut Profiteroles offer a sweet finish. Overall, Novikov Beverly Hills blends elegance, fantastic food, and great service for a truly memorable dining experience.",
      "We have been here for 4 nights straight and we loved the atmosphere and the food.\nMichael was amazing and caring server , loved his attention to details , also Isaak is amazing bartender and super fun! Check out this new hot spot , see you here :)",
      "We came to this restaurant as a group of four. They didn't bring us one of the appetizers, they mixed up the steak for one of us, and they took a very long time to take our order. We sat for about half an hour before we ordered. I didn't like the meat. I liked the cocktail and truffle risotto, so 3 stars."

      "Nice restaurant that offers a wide range of salads and paninis. They also have some low sugar beverages, like lemonade or iced tea, with refills included. Food was good and waiters were nice, the only negative aspect is the high prices, but you can expect that since it's close to Rodeo Drive.",
      "food was great, i got a chicken special panini with no sundried tomatoes. finished it in less than five minutes because it was that good. owner helped out with customers and was so nice.",
      "Used to be one of favorite panini spots, the chicken special was always on fire, used to be great late night. Get the pickles and try their special avocado sauce. Unfortunately the quality of panini has gone down a little hopefully they will bring it back up again.",
      "LOVED our meal here!!!\nThe food was so incredible. I\u2019ve never had pasta that tasted so good. It came out so fast.\nI ordered the Penne Lorenzo but split it in half to share with my dining mate and the portion ended up being perfect! You get a lot for a modest price.\nOur waiter was so incredibly kind and very attentive. He made my night with our conversation!\nWe sat outside and it was a wonderful atmosphere. You\u2019re right by Rodeo Drive and in the heart of Beverly Hills. It was a great dining experience through and through.",
      "This is a great lunch spot! They offer amazing paninis with a great variety of meat, cheese and veggie options. Paninis are certainly their specialty, and it paired well with the tomato soup.\n\nThey also have a ton of salad options. I believe they offer around 24 different salads. As you can see in the picture, they do not hold back on the protein. II Tramezzino\u2019s pasta is also quite good, but I definitely prefer the paninis.\n\nI will be coming back here again as there are a lot of items l\u2019d like to try."

      "It\u2019s mostly a positive experience here at the Peninsula. All the dishes were good except the hamachi and the Wagyu. The hamachi was a bit over cooked so for a fatty fish it was quite dry. The wagyu flavour was very interesting. It almost reminded me of Cantonese bbq pork. A bit of sweetness and char. We ordered medium rare, but pretty sure was medium well or more. Again for a fatty piece of meat it was quite dry. But all the appys were very well and the whole sea bream was fantastic. Drinks well. Love the service. Prices not too crazy.",

      "The food is excellent. A slightly different take on the traditional pasta dishes. Pasta was perfectly al dente with very delicious sauce. The pizza was ultra thin and tasty. Shaved zucchini salad, and gem lettuce were very different and yummy.\n\nOnly complaint is, the tiramisu had too much coffee for my taste.\n\nOverall the food was awesome.\nThe reason for 4 stars is the portions are very small for the amount they charge and the 18% service fee etc.",
      "Recommended by friends to come here. A must visit when you come to LA according to them. Pasta was delicious and nicely Al dente. The house salad and Gem lettuce was great. The chicken wings were too salty. The place is a tad too cramped  and crowded. Service is good.",
      "I absolutely love the minimalist ambiance of this restaurant. The food is not only beautifully presented but also delicious. However, I was a bit disappointed with the portion sizes, both for the food and wine, considering the price. On the bright side, the customer service was exceptional. Our server was incredibly friendly and accommodating, making us feel like valued guests. Overall, despite the small portions, this restaurant offers a great dining experience with its stylish atmosphere and tasty dishes.",
      "Great new restaurant location with great pizzas, a good selection of breakfast and dessert items. I ordered the Chai tea and Polenta with a fried egg. The Polenta was great and the egg was cooked perfectly. My Chai tea had enough water for two small mugs. The tea itself was a 3/5.",

      "Great experience here. Good quality food and pretty fine. Dining came in with a few guys and I did to the salad bar and the other guys had the meats.\n\nSalad bar options were great. Lots to choose from hard to not to get too full off of it. I enjoyed the stew with rice, and got the sea bass. It was amazing very buttery and soft just melts in your mouth. It's a pretty small portion now so I can. I hurts when you get it up at like $5 a bite.\n\nReason for four stars: We were told it would be 16 different servings of meat, but only about 12 came out, and we had to ask for more of the specific ones. Also, they kept bringing back other ones which is kind of tricky because it seems like they want you to get full on those. So that' kinda wasn't\ncool.\n\nInside was very  warm, and staff was very friendly.",
      "Wow! What a FUN night! We really enjoyed it! One thing though, make sure to request the cuts and meats you want for the \u201cfull\u201d experience. You may not get every cut of the full 16 if you don\u2019t ask. They just seem to bring out what they have ready. Maybe it\u2019s because we came at 9:30pm\u2026 but they will make it fresh for you if you ask. Also, the desserts are not covered in the \u201c16\u201d cut experience, so just keep that in mind, though we got our desserts covered ;)\n\nI think if the restaurant worked on a pamphlet that spoke about what the 16 cut experience is and what it includes, it would solve a lot of the misunderstood descriptions from the waiters",
      "I recently visited this restaurant in Los Angeles with my family for dinner, and it was a great choice. The salad bar had an excellent and extensive selection. As for drinks, they had a wide variety of options, and they were delicious. Finally, the meat dishes were fantastic. I always order my meat medium-rare, and it was cooked perfectly to my liking. It was some of the best meat I\u2019ve ever had. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I look forward to visiting again.",
      "My husband and I went for the first time last night (7/13/24) for my birthday and WOW 10/10 experience. From the meats to the salad bar to the cheesecake dessert, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. But our amazing server Theron made the experience 10x better. He was fun, personable, and overall EXCEPTIONAL. He loves the restaurant and his love for it, the food, and the patrons radiates off of him. Due to Theron's fantastic service, the friendly hosts, and great food, we plan on coming back next month! And probably every month!",
      "We had the best experience eating there. The staff made our family dinner top tier. Moises the manager went above and beyond to make  sure we  had excellent service.  This was by far the best dining experiences we've ever had. We will see them in a few weeks..."

      "Service is very good and the cooking technique is superb.\n\nThe only tempura I do not enjoy is the squid which is flavorless and the fermented yellowish thing on top tastes very fishy and stinky.\n\nOther than that, all tempera are very well made. The coating is thin and crispy and The ingredients are fresh. I admire the chef\u2019s skill!!!\n\nI also love that they used seasonal ingredients such as matsutake.\n\nAfter I finished the meal, I feel full but do not feel overwhelmed by greasiness because the food were properly fried.\n\nI wish they had more sake options.",
      "Tempura were all excellent. My favorites are corn, snow crab leg, shrimp, scallop w/ caviar and curry anago. Ootoro in the sashimi was a bit chewy, but after telling the waitress, chef was nice enough to give me a torched one which was much better. It\u2019s on the expensive side but both service and taste were superb. I would recommend it ;)",
      "To eat here was a culinary experience, esp if one loves tempura. Decor is quiet elegance with clean aesthetic. Service is stellar where your sake glass is never empty. The menu is carefully prepared by 2 chefs served one piece at a time. The amalgamation is flavors slowly wakens the palate from salad, corn, slowly graduating to sashimi, beef cooked on hot stone. All items are served with specific instructions ie no salt, white salt, green salt, or tempura sauce (w shredded daikon). Certainly worth a trip esp for special occasions ie my friends birthday!",

      "A legit taste of tempura to tie me over until my next visit back to Japan. Super courteous staff. Very intimate. Every dish was delicious (the corn and wagyu were my favorite).  Worth the price and will definitely be back.\n\nOther reviews mentioning lack of wifi and similar complaints seemed silly to me. They clearly don't understand what this experience is supposed to be about."

Starting with the manager Costa that was very nice and even gave us a tour of the restaurant and the fabulous vine selections. He took care of us from the beginning till the end. We also had a lovely waitress Ourania who introduce me to a wonderful red wine from Greece. She was polite, gave us a great service and very professional. The food was so delicious and so delicately presented. We even had the chance to meet the chef David who came at our table. Last minute my daughter decided to come and i called to see if i could add 1 more person to our reservation and Marvin, the assistant, i believe made it possible. Everyone was so nice and made us feel welcome. AMAZING RESTAURANT. A GEM FOR SURE.",
      "Very good cocktails. Attentive staff. My order was wrong but the other 7 people I was with got theirs fine so I\u2019m chalking it up to a fluke.\n\nThe pita and bread dips are amazing. The feta dip is a little spicy which is cool. Then there\u2019s also a feta whip with some of the dishes, which is a nice touch.\n\nOutdoor seating is well-heated so you can sit there on cold days."

      "This restaurant falls into the average category for me. The lobster was disappointingly subpar. While the services were commendable, the food didn't live up to the overall dining experience. It lacks that spark, although it does succeed in filling you up.",
      "Don\u2019t be mislead by my rating system, realistic 5 star visits are rare and it isn\u2019t that this restaurant was \u2018bad\u2019 \u2026 I am just not a fan of inflated prices based solely on location.\n\nThe fare was enjoyable although walking distance from Rodeo Drive, I expected a little more. Dining outside near the road deflected my focus away from the fact that I have had better food at half the price. Had this not been a birthday trip for my girlfriend, this review would have been a bit harsher.\n\nA bit more research could have possibly led us to a better venue but unfortunately, we were a little too close to hangry stages to continue that route. All in all, I do not regret the choice but I do not think I would return.",
      "My family used to go here a decent amount when I was younger. I had always loved it, decided to come back after having not gone in probably 15 years or so.\n\nThe food overall was very solid, but the service was slightly slow. The pizza funny enough tasted just like I remembered it, in a good way.\n\nIt did seem a bit empty, I don't know if it was just the time of day/week we chose to go, but it does feel like they need to invest a little into updating the place here and there. My wife was thinking it'd be cool if they had like a little Italian market in the space, kind of like Bay Cities.\n\nEither way, looking forward to coming back again.",
      "I came on a Tuesday and there was a salsa lesson in progress. The festive ambiance definitely was a good pairing to the drinks and food I had. The pizza was simply good. The lentil soup had a good balance between thin, tasty, and crunchy taste. The music got me to dance several songs.",
      "We had dinner at the Roma in Beverly Hills last night and it was excellent Italian food! 2 hours free parking is just a block up un N Canon Dr, additional time is $2.50/hour which is not bad for Beverly Hills. They have gas heaters for the folks sitting outside and the temperature inside the restaurant  was ideal. Food was excellent, we had Pasta, Chicken and a pizza. While everything was really good, we'll certainly return for the Pizza, tastes just as one would expect it in Italy. Location is great! As it was a pleasant December evening we went for a short stroll over to Rodeo Drive which is less than 5 minutes walking distance to admire the X-Mas decorations and lights. Prices are decent considering the location. Once again, pizza was hands down the best I've ever eaten in Los Angeles."

As they\u2019ve gotten bigger I\u2019ve noticed things perpetually getting worse: quality, portions. I ordered 3x this week, I know crazy and each portion of salad was pretty small but tonight\u2019s salads were about 1/3 full. When I tried contacting to ask why, request refund or replacement it was rejected since I had received my order. Hope they go back to how they were in the beginning considering this salad was $27.",

I mean, look at how pretty this salad is!  I always get the Cobb, and when they have the curried squash soup I jump on it.  It\u2019s a touch pricey, but the quality is worth the extra bucks.  Portions are filling, and I always feel satisfied!  Thanks for making me a convert!",
      "My family ordered from goop Kitchen tonight. This is my second time trying the food. I ordered a winter salmon bowl and it was very good. I definitely recommend it. It was a good portion. I love eating light and healthy. They have other great options. I hope to visit the location on one of my trips to LA.",

Highly recommend, great food and great customer service.",

Their soups are out of this world too. Thank you for the long hours, effort, and energy you all put into this concept; it\u2019s a dream come true!"

      "Michelin rated 2021, 2022, & 2023.....this is a high end ramen shop located on La Cienega Blvd in Beverly Hills.\n\nAll the noodles here are made fresh in house in the front of the shop on display.\n\nThe signature #1 truffle soba reminds me of the famous truffle Michelin rated ramen in Tokyo.   This is what I've had the several other times I've visited.  Today I came in specifically to try their new tsukemen (dipping ramen) Ise.\n\nIt's described as spicy yet sweet dipping ramen with noodles served on the side.  The noodles are wide and flat....very fresh too!  They also provide a side of truffle oil and green onions so you can customize your bowl.  The soup was much thicker and more intense than a normal ramen broth.  It coats the flat noodles very well.  They also give you a pretty good portion of the pork charshu.\n\nI really like this place but it is a very expensive bowl of ramen for $38.  If the price was more reasonable, I would give it a 5 star.  Even with the price at $38, I still come back.  Food is delicious!",
      "Modern ramen shop with a noodle lab boasting high-end bowls of slurpy goodness. The broth is layered in silky umami flavors. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Price point is a bit steep but that's to be expected.",
      "After reading reviews, Michelin Recommend from 2021-2023, and many different trophies. I was expected this place to be a 5 start ramen shop. However, it\u2019s disappointed. For a bowl of ramen $38 plus tax and tips, I would expect it to be nearly perfect. Chicken wings are dry not juicy. Only one server runs the entire restaurant so there is no service at all to check if the food is ok or anything else needs to be attentive. No water refill, no one came to our table to check on us. Only one staff works in the kitchen and one staff works in the back of the kitchen. After waiting for 20 mins to get our chicken wings and another 15 mins to get three bowls of ramen. The noodle texture is lack of Gluteniness of noodles. It doesn\u2019t taste as good as it should be as home made noodles. The only broth tastes the best it\u2019s the creamy broth. Salt and soy broth are both little too salty. Chicken thigh it\u2019s full of sake taste and I can\u2019t taste any chicken flavor from it. The texture of the chicken also not juice at all. Honestly, a place like this should have a lot better quality of food and service to present.",
      "Overate ramen! Too much truffle oil and it breaks all the taste. You can name that \u201cinnovation\u201d but for a person who eat ramen all over the world like me, it\u2019s really \u201coverdose\u201d. Lamb ramen, it\u2019s a joke with this price! I really don\u2019t mind to pay $70/bowl of ramen, if it\u2019s good! But not in this case! Taste-it first pls! Bright side: they have a very good serveur, he is very kind, attentive and charming. That\u2019s why even can not finish any bowl of ramen, still appreciate him with a good tip, cause it\u2019s not his fault at all.",
      "It\u2019s a unique take on ramen, good depth of flavor, great noodles, but for me the truffle dominates and the richness of the soup is too buttery.  Like it for something new, but I prefer a more traditional take. I like truffle and I have had a dozen bowls in Tokyo.  I was expecting the price, but at the end of the night it felt too steep."

      "I am Moroccan and I loved everything we had! Lovely cosy restaurant with great service and amazing waiter Ossama who took extremely good care of us all! Had a mix of several starters and everyone was happy! We will be back",
      "This place is by far the best restaurant in the area and I won't be exaggerating saying it's the best in LA. My family is Moroccan, so I know Moroccan food by heart. This place is authentic and keeps high standards for flavors and quality. The food is just so amazing it reminded me of my grandmother who passed away 20 years ago. I almost went to the kitchen to check if she is there. The vegetarian options are amazing and I'm craving them all the time! The house mezze platter is so good and rich. It's so called simple food but the flavors are so sophisticated and perfect. The baklava is great and the tea is nothing You've ever tasted. Just so amazing. The staff are so welcoming and warm, service is amazing, and we just come back over and over again as it is a gem, an absolute delight.",
      "Just ate here last night and it was amazing. The food was outstanding. Service was great, atmosphere was intimate and relaxing. It was a chilly evening in their garden patio, so I had the mint tea and it was the best mine tea I've ever had. Planning for when I can go back again. Thank you for an amazing evening!",
      "I really wanted to like this place. I love Moroccan food and was excited to try this place since I read many positive reviews on Google and Yelp. Perhaps it was an off night. Servers were very nice and patio in the back had its charm; however, the food was not to my taste. I tried the chicken bastilla which was a bit dry and did not taste fresh. The lemon chicken tagine was ok but was not what think of when I think of tagine, the chicken tasted like it was cooked separately from the sauce  and then sauce added right before serving. Lastly, the baklava was very dry and rather tasteless. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be back.",
      "My husband and I had the 9-course tasting menu to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The service was excellent and very friendly. Most of the food was delicious, especially the lamb. The scallops were the only disappointing dish. We will return to try individual entrees, but the tasting menu is not the best value for us. Thank you for a very pleasant time."

      "The service is  with a smile and such friendliness. You feel like you've been a regular for years. The food was delicious and portions were large. It definitely is going on our list to return",
      "Oh my god! This place is incredible!!! We brought our old blind dog inside and the staff brought fresh grilled chicken to him! The food- amazing! The homemade sauces are the best!!!\nI cannot express enough love to this restaurant. I WILL be coming back! 5 stars! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
      "Umm...yes! I got the California Burger, and the burger itself is seasoned so well and the whole plate was delicious with fair prices. The free cucumber water is a nice touch to an overall five-star experience.\n\nI will definitely be back.",
      "I had the fresh juice with beets, etc., brown rice with tofu, and chocolate cake. I can't say anything negative about tofus as they are my favorites I can eat every day.  I therefore conclude that the food was ok. The chocolate cake was really very sweet, similar to those that were in the frozen sections in the groceries.",
      "Continental is a cozy and welcoming family-owned restaurant owned by Ana and Vrej. They are one of the sweetest and most genuine people I've ever known. Whether you're looking to work on your computer, catch up with friends, or simply enjoy a delicious meal, they have it all. The prices are definitely reasonable (especially considering its prime location) and the variety of comforting healthy choices on the menu. Highly recommended."

      "1 had a terrible experience at this coffee shop. The service was extremely slow, taking 15 minutes to deliver a coffee to the table. I ordered a regular latte with almond milk, which cost $7.66\u2014a ridiculously high price. To make matters worse, the coffee was burned and tasted awful. I\u2019m surprised this place is so busy. This was my first and last visit, and I do not recommend it. If you want good service and quality coffee, avoid this place.",
      "Food is excellent. Takes a hit on the wallet. But the food is very good.  They also serve all day breakfast.",
      "MANDATORY 18% TIPS BUT POOR SERVICES?!?!?!\u203c\ufe0f\u2049\ufe0f\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\nWe came around at 11:30am and the restaurant was pretty empty (not a busy time). Still, our order took a long time to arrive. While we were waiting, nobody served us any water. \ud83d\ude13When the food arrived, the yogurt was spilled and there were only two sets of utensils for four people. When we asked for more utensils and water, the Mexican waiter looked really impatient and impolite. The look he gave was absolutely offensive.\ud83e\udd14When we were finished, the same waiter came with a big attitude, banding forks and knives against the plates and murmured in his mother tongue we couldn\u2019t understand. Overall, I just want to say. If you charge a mandatory 18% \u201cgratuity charge\u201d beforehand, then you should act like you deserve it. \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25",
      "We have been travelling for 5 weeks around the USA from Australia and I can honestly say this was the best coffee we have had to date.  Thank you so much Croft Alley and also do yourself a favour and try the waffles , you will not be disappointed...... simple but perfect !!!",
      "I\u2019ve been coming to this restaurant for many years. But I won\u2019t be coming back.  The portions have gotten smaller and smaller. You pay close to $30 for a meal that does not fill you up. To make matters worse, they add an 18% gratuity before tax. What are they adding this gratuity for, I really don\u2019t know. You order the food at the counter. All in all, you do not get value at this place. There are plenty of restaurants in the area that give you a decent plate of food without forcing an 18% gratuity down your throat."
