      "We went for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, because they have the softest corn beef I\u2019ve ever had along with mustard and cabbage and carrots, and the dinner was just spectacular. And of course, their cheese bread is to literally die for. Our server was quite pleasant and smiling and full of energy. Looks like they won\u2019t be moving until after the first of the year so they\u2019re in that building for the holidays. That made my mom and I very happy. She\u2019s 84 and I\u2019m 58 and we\u2019ve been going to The Derby for decades. Things seem not to change including Quality which is for the better. Never eaten here. I highly recommended at least once, and especially for a first date that sets quite the rich atmosphere and provides for intimacy as well.",
      "I love a good steakhouse and always look for the closest to my travel destination. The building and atmosphere are nice, and I like the history behind it. Our server was efficient but didn't have much charm, and was supported by others so that we didn't have to wait long for any dish. Overall the food was good, but fell a bit short of my expectations for the price point. French onion soup was delicious, and definitely on point. My NY strip was overdone but still acceptable to eat without asking them to redo it. The green beans were of varying texture and also overcooked. Mushrooms were good and the marsala sauce was a flavorful accompaniment to my steak as an alternative to butter. Salmon was cooked well and sauce was a nice pairing. Desserts were a substantial size, and the creme brulee was larger than you'd receive most places. Triple scoop of sorbet was an assortment of flavors and textures - raspberry (my favorite of the three) was creamy and not sharp, passionfruit was vibrant, but the blood orange was weak on flavor. Bread pudding was more like a dense cake than traditional preparation, but tasted good. Overall it was a satisfying dinner, but I've had much better meals at other fine steakhouses and expected a bit more here.",
      "I've loved this place throughout the years. After a great day down the steeet at Santa Anita, a perfect steak and starters is the only way to finish.\n\nEnjoyed the Calamari, Rib-eye and my date had the Prime rib. The Mac n cheese was delicious, almost like scalloped potatoes meets pasta. Wonderful, attentive service.",
      "Very tasty and a little bit expensive! But all cost every dollar! And we took three cocktails and port wine, they increased an amount...\nIt was my birthday and Derby gifted me a dessert. Very -very-very pretty place!\nThe best file minion, very good onion soup, very good appetizers and unbelievable tasty fried bread. I want to return only for this bread!\nHot Margarita is really hot spicy \ud83d\udd25 I needed to drink it with Pina Colada )))\nBeautiful place I will go again.",
      "Absolutely amazing service and food. Bobby M made us feel so welcomed , he was very attentive , helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our food very much, the entire staff was so generous and wonderful \ud83d\ude00 We look forward to co.ing back soon!"

      "We came here to celebrate my husbands bday. Food was cooked to perfection. Customer service was good. The manager is very kind gave us shots and wrote happy bday in it. We ordered the all smoke platter. We have plenty of left overs for dinner and probably the next day. We ordered it with Mac n cheese, Mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts and waffle fries. We ate during happy hour and the drinks are buy one and get on free of the same drink.",
      "Very busy place on a Friday night, and a nice selection of items on the menu. The pastrami was amazingly good, I'm so glad I chose it over the brisket - tender and full of flavor. The beef short rib was also very good, moist and tender but not fatty, although the rub was excessively salty. Pickles were perfectly pickled and crunchy. Mud pie was the choice of dessert for several at our table and was enjoyed all around. The service was sufficient but not stellar - some hospitality faux pas like serving drinks by holding the rim, and not bussing any dishes from the table until the very end of the meal. I'd definitely return for more of the delicious meat!",
      "When we first survived, we were sat down in the crowded area Not easy to get to our seats!\nThen a sworm of Kids came in at least 20 of them. They were so loud people behind us and in front of us were yelling at each other in order to be able to hear their conversation.\nSo we were brought our menus. 10 min later we were offered to order our drinks. 10-15 min later we ordered our food.\n1 hour later were served. Along with burnt shrimp as an appetizer\nOnly burnt appetizers arrived at our table. So we just ignored it. Then, as you can tell the picture, I didn't have hardly any Avacado lettuce was just thrown on the plate I had four pecans or nuts in it whatever they are in a few cranberries I had to ask for dressing because some of the dressing was already on it, which I've never had it served. That way they usually put it on the side. And I had to ask for the other fixings Avacado was smooshed in there. He was one little piece like the end of the avocado. .Then one of the guest I brought pulled a hair out of the food. After that, it was very disgusting.\nI couldn't eat anymore. Neither could anybody else\nLet the waiter know what was going on and he apologize for having our food brought up to us late. He stated that the ticket got lost in the kitchen one and two for the Hair He said he would let his manager know.\nAnd apparently the managers went to the office as we patiently waited 15 minutes for them to arrive. According to the waiter, they might be viewing the cameras that's why they're delaying coming to the table.\nThere was no reason for us to be dishonest, if anything was more humiliating to the guest that I took of the poor service not only that, but the meat was cold\nEverything was not acceptable. Then the manager comes over to tell us that she was not gonna charge us for our alcohol drinks to compensate what we have experience I believe her name was Wendy. Yes, that's her name. Poor management If you look at my other yelp reviews for this restaurant, you'll see the difference in the food!!!",
      "Food was amazing.  The birria quessadilla is a great appetizer and you can never go wrong with a pile of meat for food.  Good place to share plates if you want to try everything.  This version is in the mall and is really light and airy.  Looks totally new, which I think it is.  We got there at 6 on a Monday and it was empty bit filled up fast while we were there.  Came back at 6:15 on a Thursday and it was still empty, but filled up quick.",
      "Very, very bad service. Like extremely bad.\n\nAlso want to add they charge a 3% service fee. Since I had already waited so long for my server to come back with my change I did not bring it up and ask why. At this point I was very annoyed considering the place was practically empty besides one large party coming in while I was waiting for my change.\n\nI wanted to leave no tip considering the horrible service, but I left a small tip and took the service fee off the tip as well.\n\nIt was nice that we received a free quesadilla but it honestly doesn't make up for it, imo."
